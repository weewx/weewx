Version: 2.7.0

    <p>This document contains the following sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#Upgrading_using_setup.py">Upgrading using <span class='code'>setup.py</span></a></li>

      </ul>
    <p>The section <em><a href="#Instructions_for_specific_versions">Instructions for Specific Versions</a></em> applies to each installation method.</p>

    <p class="warning"><strong>Warning!</strong><br/>
      You must use the same upgrade technique as your initial install!<br/>
      <br/>
      For example, if you used <span class="code">setup.py</span> to install
      <span class='code'>weewx</span>, you should use
      <span class="code">setup.py</span> to upgrade.<br/>
      <br/>
      If you used a DEB or RPM package to install, then you should upgrade
      using the same package type.
    </p>

    <h1><a name="Upgrading_using_setup.py">Upgrading using <span class='code'>setup.py</span></a></h1>
    <p>Before upgrading <span class="code">weewx</span>, check the section <em>
	<a href="#Instructions_for_specific_versions">Instructions for Specific Versions</a></em> to see if any specific actions are
      required. Then follow the standard installation procedure:</p>
    <p>Unpack the archive:</p>
    <p class="tty">tar xvfz weewx-X.Y.Z.tar.gz</p>
    <p>Change directory into it:</p>
    <p class="tty">cd weewx-X.Y.Z </p>
    <p>Build the distribution:</p>
    <p class="tty">./setup.py build </p>
    <p>Install <span class='code'>weewx</span>:</p>
    <p class='warning'><strong>Warning!</strong><br/>
      Before doing the next step, be sure that <span class="code">home</span>
      in the file <span class="code">setup.cfg</span> is set to the location
      of the previous <span class='code'>weewx</span> installation.
    </p>
    <p class="tty">sudo ./setup.py install </p>
    <p>The install process will do the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save the old <span class="code">bin</span> directory as
	<span class="symcode">$WEEWX_INSTALL</span><span class='code'>/bin.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</span>
        where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is a timestamp</li>
      <li>Install the new version in the <span class="code">bin</span>
	directory, while preserving any user extensions in the
        <span class="code">bin/user</span> directory</li>
      <li>Save a copy of the old <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> as
	<span class="symcode">$WEEWX_INSTALL</span><span class='code'>/weewx.conf.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</span>
      </li>
      <li>Merge any changes made to the old configuration file
	<span class="code">weewx.conf</span> into the new configuration file,
        then install the merged copy.  This effectively causes any changes
        to override the values in the new version of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
      </li>
      <li>Install a <span class="code">skins</span> directory if 
	one does not already exist. </li>
    </ul>

    <h1><a name="Upgrading_using_DEB_package">Upgrading using DEB package</a></h1>
    <p>Upgrade to X.Y.Z like this:</p>
    <p class='tty'>sudo dpkg -i weewx_X.Y.Z-R.deb</p>
    <p>The upgrade process will not modify the <span class='code'>weewx</span>
      databases.</p>
    <p>Unmodified files will be upgraded.  If modifications have been made to
      the weewx configuration, you will be prompted as to whether you want to
      keep the existing configuration or accept the new configuration.  Either
      way, <span class='code'>dpkg</span> will save a copy of the option you
      did not choose.</p>
    <p>For example, if <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span> was
      modified, <span class='code'>dpkg</span> will present a message something
      like this:</p>
    <p class='tty'>Configuration file `/etc/weewx/weewx.conf'
      &nbsp;==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
      &nbsp;==&gt; Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D     : show the differences between the versions
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
      &nbsp;The default action is to keep your current version.
*** weewx.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?</p>
    <p>Choosing <span class='code'>I</span> (install the new version) will
      place the previous configuration in
      <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf.dpkg-old</span> where it can
      be compared with the new version
      <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span>
    </p>
    <p>Choosing <span class='code'>O</span> (keep the current version) will
      place the new configuration in 
      <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf.dpkg-new</span> where it can
      be compared with the old version
      <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span>
    </p>


    <h1><a name="Upgrading_using_RPM_package">Upgrading using RPM package</a></h1>
    <p>Upgrade to X.Y.Z like this:</p>
    <p class='tty'>sudo rpm -U weewx-X.Y.Z-R.rpm</p>
    <p>The upgrade process will not modify the <span class='code'>weewx</span>
      databases.</p>
    <p>Unmodified files will be upgraded.  If modifications have been made to
      the configuration, <span class='code'>rpm</span> will display a message
      about any differences between the changes and the new configuration.  Any
      new changes from the upgrade will be noted as files with a
      <span class='code'>.rpmnew</span> extension and the modified files will
      be left untouched.</p>
    <p>For example, if <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span> was
      modified, <span class='code'>rpm</span> will present a message something
      like this:</p> 
    <p class='tty'>warning: /etc/weewx/weewx.conf created as /etc/weewx/weewx.conf.rpmnew</p>

    <h1><a name="Instructions_for_specific_versions">Instructions for specific versions</a></h1>

  <h2>V2.6 or earlier</h2>
  <p>Version 2.7 is backwards compatible with earlier versions with
    one minor exception.</p>
  <p>
    It now includes the ability to localize the weewx and server
    uptimes. Previously, the labels <span class="code">days</span>, <span
      class="code">hours</span>, and <span class="code">minutes</span>
    were hardcoded in a Python utility. There was no way of changing
    them. Now, like any other labels, they are taken from the skin
    configuration file, <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, section <span
      class="code">[[Labels]]</span>. Older configuration files had a
    definition for <span class="code">hour</span>, but none for <span
      class="code">day</span>, and <span class="code">minute</span>.
    Also, the old definition for <span class="code">hour</span> used an
    abbreviation <span class="code">hrs</span> instead of <span
      class="code">hours</span>.
  </p>
  <p>If you do nothing, your weewx and station uptimes will look
    like:</p>
  <pre class="tty">Weewx uptime:  1 day, 1 hrs, 41 minutes
Server uptime: 2 days, 10 hrs, 22 minutes</pre>
  <p>
    Note how the label for hours is abbreviated and always uses the
    plural. If you want the previous behavior, or if you want to
    localize the labels, you should update your skin configuration file.
    Remove the old entries for <span class="code">hour</span> and <span
      class="code">second</span> and replace them with:
  </p>
  <pre class="tty">
day               = " day",    " days"
hour              = " hour",   " hours"
minute            = " minute", " minutes"
second            = " second", " seconds"</pre>
        
  <p>The first item is the singular spelling, the second the plural. This
  will result in the desired</p>
  <pre class="tty">Weewx uptime:  1 day, 1 hour, 41 minutes
Server uptime: 2 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes</pre>

  <h2>V2.5 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Version 2.6 is backwards compatible with earlier versions, with a couple
    of small exceptions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have written a custom <span class="code">weewx</span>
      service, the install routine will try to insert its name into
      an appropriate place in one of the five new lists of services
      to be run. You should check
      section <span class="code">[Engines][[WxEngine]]</span> to
      make sure it made a reasonable guess.</li>
      <li>If you have written a custom RESTful service, the
      architecture for these services has completely changed. They
      are now first class services, and are treated like any other
      <span class="code">weewx</span> service. There are some guides
      to writing RESTful services using the new architecture at the
      top of the file <span class='code'>bin/weewx/restx.py</span>. 
      I can also help you with the transition.</li>
      <li>Option <span class='code'>interval</span> in the CWOP
      configuration section has become option 
      <span class='code'>post_interval</span>. This change
      should be done automatically by the install routine. </li>
      <li>The mechanism for specifying RESTful services has changed.
      To activate a RESTful service, put the driver in the
      <span class="code">restful_services</span> list in
      <span class="code">[Engines][[WxEngine]]</span>.  The
      <span class="code">driver</span> parameter is no longer
      necessary in the RESTful service's configuration stanza.
      These changes should be done automatically by the
      install routine.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>V2.3 or earlier</h2>
    <p>The option <span class="code">time_length</span> will now be the exact length 
      of the resultant plot. Before, a plot with <span class="code">time_length</span> 
      equal to 24 hours would result in a plot of 27 hours, now it's 24 hours. If you 
      want the old behavior, set it equal to 27 hours. To do this, change your section 
      in <span class="code">skin.conf</span> from</p>
    <p class="tty">[[day_images]]
    x_label_format = %H:%M 
    bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M 
    time_length = 86400 # == 24 hours</p>
    <p>to</p>
    <p class="tty">[[day_images]] 
    x_label_format = %H:%M 
    bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M 
    <span class="highlight">time_length = 97200 # == 27 hours</span></p>
    <p>The service <span class="code">StdTimeSync</span> now synchronizes the console's 
     onboard clock on startup. This is nice because if the clock failed, perhaps because 
     the battery was taken out, the time is corrected first <em>before</em> data is downloaded 
     from the logger's memory. To take advantage of this, you can move service
     <span class="code">StdTimeSync</span> to the front of the list of services to be 
     run. For example:</p>
    <p class="tty">[[WxEngine]]
    # The list of services the main weewx engine should run:
    service_list = <span class="highlight">weewx.wxengine.StdTimeSynch</span>, weewx.wxengine.StdConvert, weewx.wxengine.StdCalibrate, weewx.wxengine.StdQC, weewx.wxengine.StdArchive, weewx.wxengine.StdPrint, weewx.wxengine.StdRESTful, weewx.wxengine.StdReport
</p>
	
	<h2>V2.2 or earlier</h2>
	<p>The signature of the function "<span class="code">loader</span>", used to 
	return an instance of the station device driver, has changed slightly. It 
	has changed from</p>
	<p class="tty">loader(config_dict)</p>
	<p>to</p>
	<p class="tty">loader(config_dict, engine)</p>
	<p>That is, a second parameter, <span class="code">engine</span>, has been 
	added. This is a reference to the <span class="code">weewx</span> engine.</p>
	<p>This change will affect only those who have written their own device 
	driver. </p>
    <h2>V2.1 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Version 2.2 introduces a schema, found in <span class="code">
        bin/user/schemas.py</span>, for the stats database. This schema is
      used only when initially creating the database. If you have a specialized
      stats database, that is, one that saves types other than the default that
      comes with <span class="code">weewx</span>, you should edit this file to
      reflect your changes before attempting to rebuild the database.</p>

    <h2>V1.14 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Version 2.0 introduces many new features, including a revamped internal 
      engine. There are two changes that are not backwards compatible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The configuration file, <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. When 
	upgrading from V1.X, the setup utility will 
        install a new, fresh copy of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>,
        which you will then have to edit by hand. Thereafter, V2.X upgrades
        should be automatic.</li>
      <li>Custom services. If you have written a custom service, it will have
        to be updated to use the new engine. The overall architecture is very
        similar, except that functions must be <em>bound</em> to events, rather
        than get called implicitly. See the sections <a href="customizing.htm#Customizing_a_Service">Customizing a Service</a> and <a href="customizing.htm#Adding_a_Service">Adding a Service</a> in the <a href="customizing.htm">Customizing Guide</a> for details on how to do this.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All skins should be completely backwards compatible, so you should not
      have to change your templates or skin configuration file,
      <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. </p>
    <p>If you have written a custom report generator it should also be
      backwards compatible.</p>

    <h2>V1.13 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Version 1.14 introduces some new webpages that have been expressly
      formatted for the smartphone by using
      <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>
    <p>The skins shipped with the distribution take advantage of these
      features. If you do nothing, your old skins will continue to work, but
      you will not be taking advantage of these new webpages.</p>
    <p>If you want them, then you have two choices:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Rename your old skin directory (call it &quot;<span class="code">skins.old</span>&quot;) 
	then do the install. This will install the new skin distribution. You can 
	then modify it to reflect any changes you have made, referring to <span class="code">
	  skins.old</span> for guidance. If you have not changed many things, this 
	approach will be the easiest.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, change the contents of your existing skin directory to 
	include the new webpages. If you take this approach, you will need to copy 
	over the contents of the subdirectory <span class="code">
	  skins/Standard/smartphone</span> from the distribution into your <span class="code">skins/Standard</span> 
	directory. You will then need to modify your <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
      <p>After the section that looks like</p>
      <p class='tty'>[[[Mobile]]]
    template = mobile.html.tmpl</p>
      <p>add the following directives:</p>
      <p class='tty'>[[[MobileSmartphone]]]
    template = smartphone/index.html.tmpl
    [[[MobileTempOutside]]]
        template = smartphone/temp_outside.html.tmpl
    [[[MobileRain]]]
        template = smartphone/rain.html.tmpl
    [[[MobileBarometer]]]
        template = smartphone/barometer.html.tmpl
    [[[MobileWind]]]
        template = smartphone/wind.html.tmpl
    [[[MobileRadar]]]
        template = smartphone/radar.html.tmpl</p>
      <p>Then modify section <span class="code">[CopyGenerator]</span> 
        to add the <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> files:</p>
      <p class='tty'>[CopyGenerator]
    #
    # This section is used by the generator CopyGenerator
    #

    # List of files that are to be copied at the first invocation of the generator only
    copy_once = backgrounds/*, weewx.css, mobile.css, favicon.ico, <span class="highlight">smartphone/icons/*, smartphone/custom.js</span></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whichever approach you chose, the generated files will appear in
      <span class="code">public_html/smartphone</span>. The start of the document root 
      will be at <span class="code">public_html/smartphone/index.html</span>. You may want 
      to add a link to this in the template for your main index page
      <span class="code">skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl</span>.</p>
    <h2>V1.12 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Version 1.13 changed the way binding happens to the databases used in reports 
      so that it happens much later. The upshot is that the signature of a few 
      functions changed. Most you are unlikely to encounter. The exception is if you 
      have written custom template <em>search lists</em>, as described in the section <em>
        <a href="customizing.htm#Extending_an_existing_generator">Extending an existing report generator</a></em> in the
      <a href="customizing.htm">Customizing weewx guide</a>. This section has been 
      updated to reflect the new function signatures. As a side effect, the 
      illustrated example actually has become much simpler!</p>
    <p>No changes to skins.</p>
    <h2>V1.9 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Version 1.10 introduced several new features. </p>
    <h3>New almanac features, icon, and mobile template</h3>
    <p>Version 1.10 introduces some extra almanac features, such as the azimuth and 
      elevation of the sun and moon, or when the next solstice will be. It also 
      includes a template formatted for smartphones, as well as an icon (&quot;<span class="code">favicon.ico</span>&quot;) 
      that displays in your browser toolbar. The skins shipped with the distribution 
      take advantage of these features. If you do nothing, your old skins will 
      continue to work, but you will not take advantage of these new features. </p>
    <p>If you want these new features then you have two choices:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Rename your old skin directory (call it &quot;<span class="code">skin.old</span>&quot;) 
	then do the install. This will install the new skin distribution. You can 
	modify it to reflect any changes you have made, referring to <span class="code">
	  skin.old</span> for guidance.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, change the contents of your existing skin directory to take 
	advantage of the new features. If you take this approach, you will need to 
	copy over files <span class="code">favicon.ico, mobile.css</span>, and
	<span class="code">mobile.html.tmpl</span> from the distribution into your <span class="code">skin/Standard</span> 
	directory. Modify <span class="code">skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl</span> 
	to take advantage of the new almanac features, using the version shipped 
	with the distribution for guidance. You will then need to modify your <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
	<p>Add a new <span class="code">[[[Mobile]]]</span> section:</p>
	<p class="tty">[FileGenerator]
    ...
    [[ToDate]]
        ...
        [[[Mobile]]]
            template = mobile.html.tmpl</p>
	<p>Then add <span class="code">mobile.css</span> and <span class="code">
	    favicon.ico</span> to the list of files to be copied on report generation:</p>
	<p class="tty">[CopyGenerator]
    copy_once = backgrounds/*, weewx.css, mobile.css, favicon.ico</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Which approach you should take will depend on how extensively you have 
      modified the stock skin distribution. If the modifications are slight, approach 
      #1 will be easier, otherwise use approach #2.</p>
    <h3>Backwards compatibility</h3>
    <p>With the introduction of explicit control of output units in the templates 
      such as</p>
    <p class="tty">$day.outTemp.max.degree_C</p>
    <p>the calling signature of the following two Python classes was changed</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="code">weewx.stats.TaggedStats</span></li>
      <li><span class="code">weewx.stats.TimeSpanStats</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The example of writing a custom generator <span class="code">MyFileGenerator</span> 
      (which produced &quot;all time&quot; statistics) has been changed to reflect the new 
      signatures.</p>
    <p>This will only affect you if you have written a custom generator.</p>
    <h2>V1.7.0 or earlier</h2>
    <p>With the introduction of a standard archiving service, <span class="code">
        StdArchive</span>, the names of some events have changed. This will not affect 
      you unless you have written a custom service.</p>
    <h2>V.1.5.0 or earlier</h2>
    <p>V1.7 introduces <em>skins</em>. The skins live in subdirectory
      <span class="code">skins</span>. They are <em>not</em> compatible with the old
      <span class="code">template</span> subdirectory --- you can&#39;t simply rename
      <span class="code">templates</span> to <span class="code">skins</span>. </p>
    <p>The part of the configuration file dealing with the presentation layer has 
      been split off into a separate file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. Hence, 
      once again, the installation script
      <span class="code">setup.py</span> will NOT merge your old <span class="code">
        weewx.conf</span> configuration file 
      into the new one. You will have to re-edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> 
      to put in your customizations. You may also have to edit <span class="code">
        skin.conf</span> for whatever skin you choose (right now, only one skin, <em>Standard</em>, 
      comes with the distribution).</p>
    <p>However, a reinstall of V1.7 <em>will</em> merge your changes for
      <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. It will also merge any changes you have made to <span class="code">skin.conf</span> 
      as well.</p>
    <p>Please check the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Option &quot;<span class="code">altitude</span>&quot; in section
	<span class="code">[Station]</span> now takes a unit. Hence, it should look 
	something like:	<p class='tty'> altitude = 120, meter</p><br/>
      </li>
      <li>In a similar manner, options <span class="code">heating_base</span> and
	<span class="code">cooling_base</span> in <span class="code">skin.conf</span> 
	also take units:
	<p class='tty'>heating_base = 65, degree_F
cooling_base = 65, degree_F</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The directory &#39;<span class="code">templates</span>&#39; is no longer used; 
      it has been replaced with directory &#39;<span class="code">skins</span>&#39;. You 
      may delete it if you wish:</p>
    <p class="tty">rm -r <span class='symcode'>$WEEWX_ROOT</span>/templates</p>
    <h2>V1.4.0 or earlier</h2>
    <p>Because the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> changed 
      significantly going from V1.4 to V1.5, the installation script
      <span class="code">setup.py</span> will NOT merge your old configuration file 
      into the new one. You will have to re-edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> 
      to put in your customizations.</p>
    <h2>V1.2.0 or earlier</h2>
    <h3>Optional</h3>
    <p>Option <span class="code">clock_check</span>, previously found in the <span class="code">[VantagePro]</span> section, is now found in the
      <span class="code">[Station]</span> section. The install program will put a 
      default value in the new place, but it will not delete nor move your old value 
      over. If you have changed this value or if you can&#39;t stand the thought of
      <span class="code">clock_check</span> appearing in two different places, you 
      should delete the old one found under <span class="code">[VantagePro]</span> and 
      make sure the new value, found under <span class="code">[Station]</span> is 
      correct.</p>
    <p>Two Python files are no longer used, so they may be deleted from your 
      installation if you wish:</p>
    <p class="tty">rm <span class='symcode'>$WEEWX_ROOT</span>/bin/weewx/processdata.py
rm <span class='symcode'>$WEEWX_ROOT</span>/bin/weewx/mainloop.py</p>
    <p>In addition, file <span class="code">readme.htm</span> has been moved to 
      subdirectory <span class="symcode">$WEEWX_ROOT</span><span class='code'>/docs</span>, so the old one 
      can be deleted:</p>
    <p class="tty">rm <span class='symcode'>$WEEWX_ROOT</span>/readme.htm</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
