# [WeeWX](https://www.weewx.com)
*Open source software for your weather station*

## Description

The WeeWX weather system is written in Python and runs on Linux, MacOSX,
Solaris, and *BSD.  It runs exceptionally well on a Raspberry Pi.  It collects
data from many different types of weather stations and sensors, then generates
plots, HTML pages, and monthly and yearly summary reports. It can push plots,
pages, and reports to a web server, as well as upload weather-related data to 
many online weather services.  Thousands of users worldwide!

See the WeeWX website for [examples](https://weewx.com/showcase.html) of
websites generated by WeeWX, and a [map](https://weewx.com/stations.html) of
