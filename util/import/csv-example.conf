# Specify the source. Available options are:
#   CSV - import obs from a single CSV format file
#   WU - import obs from a Weather Underground PWS history
#   Cumulus - import obs from a one or more Cumulus monthly log files
#   WD - import obs from a one or more WD monthly log files
# Format is:
#   source = (CSV | WU | Cumulus)
source = CSV

[CSV]
    # Parameters used when importing from a CSV file

    # Path and name of our CSV source file. Format is:
    #   file = full path and filename
    file = /var/tmp/data.csv

    # The character used to separate fields. Format is:
    #   delimiter = <single character>
    # Default is , (comma).
    delimiter = ,

    # If there is no mapped interval field how will the interval field be
    # determined for the imported records. Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of x minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #
    # Note: If there is a mapped interval field then this setting will be
    #       ignored.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    interval = derive

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    calc_missing = True

    # Specify how imported data fields that contain invalid data (eg a numeric
    # field containing non-numeric data) are handled. Available options are:
    #   True  - The invalid data is ignored, the WeeWX target field is set to
    #           None and the import continues.
    #   False - The import is halted.
    # Format is:
    #   ignore_invalid_data = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    ignore_invalid_data = True

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of tranche
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    tranche = 250

    # Specify whether a UV sensor was used to produce any UV observations.
    # Available options are:
    #   True  - UV sensor was used and UV data will be imported.
    #   False - UV sensor was not used and any UV data will not be imported.
    #           UV fields will be set to None/NULL.
    # For a CSV import UV_sensor should be set to False if a UV sensor was
    # NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise it may be set to
    # True or omitted. Format is:
    #   UV_sensor = (True | False)
    UV_sensor = True

    # Specify whether a solar radiation sensor was used to produce any solar
    # radiation observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - Solar radiation sensor was used and solar radiation data will
    #           be imported.
    #   False - Solar radiation sensor was not used and any solar radiation
    #           data will not be imported. radiation fields will be set to
    #           None/NULL.
    # For a CSV import solar_sensor should be set to False if a solar radiation
    # sensor was NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise it may
    # be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   solar_sensor = (True | False)
    solar_sensor = True

    # Date-time format of CSV field from which the WeeWX archive record
    # dateTime field is to be extracted. wee_import first attempts to interpret
    # date/time info in this format, if this fails it then attempts to
    # interpret it as a timestamp and if this fails it then raises an error.
    # Uses Python strptime() format codes.
    # raw_datetime_format = Python strptime() format string
    raw_datetime_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

    # Does the imported rain field represent the total rainfall since the last
    # record or a cumulative value. Available options are:
    #   discrete   - rain field represents total rainfall since last record
    #   cumulative - rain field represents a cumulative rainfall reset at
    #                midnight
    # rain = (discrete | cumulative)
    rain = cumulative

    # Lower and upper bounds for imported wind direction. It is possible,
    # particularly for a calculated direction, to have a value (eg -45) outside
    # of the WeeWX limits (0 to 360 inclusive). Format is:
    #
    # wind_direction = lower,upper
    #
    # where :
    #   lower is the lower limit of acceptable wind direction in degrees
    #   (may be negative)
    #   upper is the upper limit of acceptable wind direction in degrees
    #
    # Imported values from lower to upper will be normalised to the range 0 to
    # 360. Values outside of the parameter range will be stored as None.
    # Default is -360,360.
    wind_direction = -360,360

    # Map CSV record fields to WeeWX archive fields. Format is:
    #
    #   weewx_archive_field_name = csv_field_name, weewx_unit_name
    #
    # where:
    #   weewx_archive_field_name - An observation name in the WeeWX database
    #                              schema.
    #   csv_field_name           - The name of a field from the CSV file.
    #   weewx_unit_name          - The name of the units, as defined in WeeWX,
    #                              used by csv_field_name. wee_import will do
    #                              the necessary conversions to the unit system
    #                              used by the WeeWX archive.
    # For example,
    #   outTemp = Temp, degree_C
    # would map the CSV field Temp, in degrees C, to the archive field outTemp.
    #
    # A mapping for WeeWX field dateTime is mandatory and the WeeWX unit name
    # for the dateTime mapping must be unix_epoch. For example,
    #   dateTime = csv_date_and_time, unix_epoch
    # would map the CSV field csv_date_and_time to the WeeWX dateTime field with
    # the csv_date_and_time field being interpreted first using the format
    # specified at the raw_datetime_format config option and if that fails as a
    # unix epoch timestamp.
    #
    # Field mapping to the WeeWX usUnits archive field is currently not
    # supported. If a usUnits field exists in the CSV data it should not be
    # mapped, rather WeeWX unit names should included against each field to be
    # imported in the field map.
    #
    # WeeWX archive fields that do not exist in the CSV data may be omitted.
    # Any omitted fields that are derived (eg dewpoint) may be calculated
    # during import using the equivalent of the WeeWX StdWXCalculate service
    # through setting the calc-missing parameter above.
