    # WD uses multiple log files some of which are in space delimited text
    # format, some are in csv format and some in both. wee_import can process
    # the following WD log files (actual log file names have 5 or 6 digits
    # prepended representing a 1 or 2 digit month and a 4 digit year, these
    # digits have been omitted for clarity):
    #   - lg.txt (same content as lgcsv.csv)
    #   - lgcsv.csv (same content as lg.txt)
    #   - vantageextrasensorslog.csv
    #   - vantagelog.txt (same content as vantagelogcsv.csv)
    #   - vantagelogcsv.csv (same content as vantagelog.txt)
    # Specify log files to be imported. Format is a comma separated list
    # including at least one of the supported log files. Do not include
    # prepended month and year digits. Default is lg.txt, vantagelog.txt
    # and vantageextrasensorslog.csv.
    logs_to_process = lg.txt, vantagelog.txt, vantageextrasensorslog.csv

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.
    # Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of x minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #            This setting is recommended for WU and WD imports.
    # To import WD monthyl log data it is recommended that the interval setting
    # be set to 1 minute.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    interval = 1

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    calc_missing = True

    # Specify the character used as the field delimiter in .txt monthly log
    # files. Normally set to the space character. The character must be
    # enclosed in quotes. Must not be the sam# as the decimal setting below.
    # Format is:
    #   txt_delimiter = ' '
    txt_delimiter = ' '

    # Specify the character used as the field delimiter in .csv monthly log
    # files. Normally set to a comma. The character must be enclosed in
    # quotes. Must not be the same as the decimal setting below. Format is:
    #   csv_delimiter = ','
    csv_delimiter = ','

    # Specify the character used as the decimal point. WD monthly log files
    # normally use a full stop character as the decimal point. The character
    # must be enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same as the xt_delimiter
    # or csv_delimiter settings. Format is:
    #   decimal = '.'
    decimal = '.'

    # Specify whether missing log files are to be ignored or abort the import.
    # WD log files are complete in themselves and a missing log file will have
    # no effect on any other records (eg rain as a delta).
    # Format is:
    #   ignore_missing_log = (True | False)
    # Default is True
    ignore_missing_log = True

    # Specify how imported data fields that contain invalid data (eg a numeric
    # field containing non-numeric data) are handled. Available options are:
    #   True  - The invalid data is ignored, the WeeWX target field is set to
    #           None and the import continues.
    #   False - The import is halted.
    # Format is:
    #   ignore_invalid_data = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    ignore_invalid_data = True

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of tranche
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    tranche = 250

    # Specify whether a UV sensor was used to produce any UV observations.
    # Available options are:
    #   True  - UV sensor was used and UV data will be imported.
    #   False - UV sensor was not used and any UV data will not be imported.
    #           UV fields will be set to None/NULL.
    # For a WD monthly log file import UV_sensor should be set to False if a UV
    # sensor was NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise it may
    # be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   UV_sensor = (True | False)
    # The default is True.
    UV_sensor = True

    # Specify whether a solar radiation sensor was used to produce any solar
    # radiation observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - Solar radiation sensor was used and solar radiation data will
    #           be imported.
    #   False - Solar radiation sensor was not used and any solar radiation
    #           data will not be imported. radiation fields will be set to
    #           None/NULL.
    # For a WD monthly log file import solar_sensor should be set to False if a
    # solar radiation sensor was NOT present when the import data was created.
    # Otherwise it may be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   solar_sensor = (True | False)
    # The default is True.
    solar_sensor = True

    # Specify whether to ignore temperature and humidity reading of 255.0.
    # WD logs can include values of 255.0 or 255. These values are usually
    # associated with an absent or disconnected senor. In WeeWX the lack of a
    # sensor/sensor data results in the value None (or null in SQL) being
    # recorded. If ignore_extreme_temp_hum is set to True temperature and
    # humidity values of 255 are ignored. Format is:
    #   ignore_extreme_temp_hum = (True | False)
    # The default is True
    ignore_extreme_temp_hum = True

    # For correct import of the monthly logs wee_import needs to know what
    # units are used in the imported data. The units used in the WD log files
    # are set to either Metric or US in WD via the 'Log File' setting under
    # 'Units' on the 'Units/Wind Chill' tab of the WD universal setup. If
    # Metric or US units have been used in the log files then it is usually
    # sufficient to set the units config option in the [[Units]] stanza to
    # Metric or US. For example:
    # [[Units]]
    #     units = metric
    # However, in cases where Metric or US may not have been used (eg a custom
    # log file) then the units config option should not be used but rather
    # units should be specified for temperature, pressure, rainfall and speed
    # groups using the temperature, pressure, rain and speed config options.
    # In each case the config option should be set to a WeeWX unit option. For
    # example:
    # [[Units]]
    #     temperature = degree_C    # options are 'degree_F' or 'degree_C'
    #     pressure = hPa            # options are 'inHg', 'mbar' or 'hPa'
    #     rain = mm                 # options are 'inch' or 'mm'
    #     speed = km_per_hour       # options are 'mile_per_hour',
    #                               # 'km_per_hour', 'knot' or
    #                               # 'meter_per_second'
    # Note that either the units config option should be set or the individual
    # unit group config options but not both.
    [[Units]]
        units = metric

    # Map WD log fields to WeeWX archive fields. Format is:
    #
    #   weewx_archive_field_name = wd_field_name
    #
    # where:
    #   weewx_archive_field_name - An observation name in the WeeWX database
    #                              schema.
    #   wd_field_name            - The name of a WD field from the CSV file.
    # For example,
    #   outTemp = temperature
    # would map the WD log field temperature to the archive field outTemp.
    #
    # Note that due to some issues with the field names used in some WD logs
    # weeimport uses the following field names when reading WD log data:
    #    temperature
    #    humidity
    #    dewpoint
    #    barometer
    #    windspeed
    #    gustspeed
    #    direction
    #    rainlastmin
    #    heatindex
    #    radiation in lieu of 'Solar radation' and ''Solar ,radiat.'
    #    uv in lieu of 'UV'
    #    soilmoist in lieu of 'soil moist'
    #    soiltemp in lieu of 'soil temp'
    #    temp1
    #    temp2
    #    temp3
    #    temp4
    #    temp5
    #    temp6
    #    temp7
    #    hum1
    #    hum2
    #    hum3
    #    hum4
    #    hum5
    #    hum6
    #    hum7
    #
    # WeeWX archive fields that do not exist in the logs to be imported may be
    # omitted (it is usually safest to omit fields for which you know there is
    # no data to import as otherwise you may end up with a value of 0 (or
    # something else) in the WeeWX archive when the appropriate value is
    # None/null). Any omitted fields that are derived (eg dewpoint) may be
    # calculated during import using the equivalent of the WeeWX StdWXCalculate
    # service through setting the calc-missing config option above. Note also
    # that whilst there may be a mapping for a field and the WD log may contain
    # valid data the only fields that will be saved to the WeeWX archive are
    # those fields in the in-use schema. Refer to the 'Archive types' appendix
    # and the 'Customizing the database' section of the Customization Guide.
