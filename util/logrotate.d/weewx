  ## On some older systems the permissions do not propagate, so force them
  # create 644 root adm   # Default user/group on Debian
  # create 644 syslog adm # Default user/group on Ubuntu
  # create 644 root root  # Default user/group on CentOS, etc

  ## Unless you use "copytruncate" rsyslog must - on some older systems - be
  ## reloaded to send output to right file

  ## Restarting service on a given Linux distribution will be OS and implementation
  ## specific and this example configuration can not cover all.

  ## You are required to check the commands and verify with method works on your system.
  ##
  # sharedscripts  # Run the command only _once_, not pr file.
  # postrotate     # Run the script after rotation is done.
  ###
  ### Test the commands and select _one_ which works
  ###
  ### On systems with SystemD
  #   systemctl kill -s HUP rsyslog.service
  ### On systems that have "pgrep / pkill"
  #   pkill -HUP rsyslog
  ### If SysV init scripts are available
  #   /etc/init.d/rsyslog stop
  #   /etc/init.d/rsyslog start
  ### SysV where reload is available
  #   /etc/init.d/rsyslog reload > /dev/null
  ### Ubuntu systems with upstart
  #   service rsyslog restart > /dev/null
  ### Some (older?) RedHat/Fedora systems have the "reload" command
  #   reload rsyslog > /dev/null 2>&1
  # Debian systems might have this command available
  #   invoke-rc.d rsyslog reload > /dev/null
  # endscript
