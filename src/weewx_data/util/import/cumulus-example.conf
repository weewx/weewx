#   Cumulus - import obs from a one or more Cumulus monthly log files
#   WD - import obs from a one or more WD monthly log files

[Cumulus]
    # Parameters used when importing Cumulus monthly log files
    #
    # Directory containing Cumulus monthly log files to be imported. Format is:
    #   directory = full path without trailing /
    directory = /var/tmp/cumulus
    
    # Specify the character used as the date separator as Cumulus monthly log
    # files may not always use a solidus to separate date fields in the monthly
    # log files. The character must be enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same
    # as the delimiter setting below. Format is:
    #   separator = '<single character>'
    # Default is '/' (solidus).    
    separator = '/'

    # Specify the character used as the field delimiter as Cumulus monthly log
    # files may not always use a comma to delimit fields in the monthly log
    # files. The character must be enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same
    # as the decimal setting below. Format is:
    #   delimiter = '<single character>'
    # Default is ',' (comma).
    delimiter = ','

    # Specify the character used as the decimal point. Cumulus monthly log
    # files may not always use a period as the decimal point. The
    # character must be enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same as the
    # delimiter setting. Format is:
    #   decimal = '<single character>'
    # Default is '.' (period).
    decimal = '.'

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.
    # Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when there are no missing
    #            records from period being imported. Missing records will
    #            cause the interval field to be incorrectly calculated for some
    #            records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX or some other means with the same archive interval as
    #            set in weewx.conf on this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of 'x' minutes for every record where 'x'
    #            is a number. This setting is best used if the records to be
    #            imported are equally spaced in time but there are some missing
    #            records.
    # To import Cumulus records it is recommended that the interval setting
    # be set to the value used in Cumulus as the 'data log interval' in minutes.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    # Default is derive.
    interval = x

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    calc_missing = True

    # Specify how imported data fields that contain invalid data (eg a numeric
    # field containing non-numeric data) are handled. Available options are:
    #   True  - The invalid data is ignored, the WeeWX target field is set to
    #           None and the import continues.
    #   False - The import is halted.
    # Format is:
    #   ignore_invalid_data = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    ignore_invalid_data = True

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of 'tranche'
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    # Default is 250.
    tranche = 250

    # Specify whether a UV sensor was used to produce UV observation data.
    # Available options are:
    #   True  - UV sensor was used and UV data will be imported.
    #   False - UV sensor was not used and any UV data will not be imported.
    #           UV field will be set to None/NULL.
    # For a Cumulus monthly log file import UV_sensor should be set to False if
    # a UV sensor was NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise
    # it may be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   UV_sensor = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    UV_sensor = True

    # Specify whether a solar radiation sensor was used to produce solar
    # radiation observation data. Available options are:
    #   True  - Solar radiation sensor was used and solar radiation data will
    #           be imported.
    #   False - Solar radiation sensor was not used and any solar radiation
    #           data will not be imported. radiation field will be set to
    #           None/NULL.
    # For a Cumulus monthly log file import solar_sensor should be set to False
    # if a solar radiation sensor was NOT present when the import data was
    # created. Otherwise it may be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   solar_sensor = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    solar_sensor = True

    # Map Cumulus fields to WeeWX archive fields. Format for each map entry is:
    #
    #   [[[weewx_archive_field_name]]]
    #       source_field = cumulus_field_name
    #       unit = weewx_unit_name
    #       is_cumulative = True | False
    #       is_text = True | False
    #
    # where:
    #   weewx_archive_field_name - An observation name in the WeeWX database
    #                              schema.
    #   source_field             - Config option specifying the Cumulus field
    #                              being mapped.
    #   cumulus_field_name       - The name of a field from the Cumulus log file.
    #   unit                     - Config option specifying the unit used by
    #                              the Cumulus field being mapped.
    #   weewx_unit_name          - The WeeWX unit name for the the units used
    #                              by cumulus_field_name.
    #   is_cumulative            - Config option specifying whether the Cumulus
    #                              field being mapped is cumulative,
    #                              e.g: dayrain. Optional, default value is
    #                              False.
    #   is_text                  - Config option specifying whether the Cumulus
    #                              field being mapped is text. Optional,
    #                              default value is False.
    # For example,
    #   [[[outTemp]]]
    #       source_field = cur_out_temp
    #       unit = degree_C
    # would map the Cumulus field 'cur_out_temp', in degrees C, to the WeeWX
    # archive field 'outTemp'.
    #
    # A mapping for WeeWX field 'dateTime' is mandatory and the WeeWX unit name
    # for the 'dateTime' mapping must be 'unix_epoch'. For example,
    #   [[[dateTime]]]
    #       source_field = datetime
    #       unit = unix_epoch
    # would map the Cumulus field 'datetime' to the WeeWX 'dateTime' field.
    #
    # WeeWX archive fields that do not exist in the Cumulus data may be
    # omitted. Any omitted fields that are derived (eg 'dewpoint') may be
    # calculated during import using the equivalent of the WeeWX StdWXCalculate
    # service through setting the 'calc-missing' parameter above.
    #
    # An example field map stanza is provided below. Once the units are
    # adjusted this field map should suit most users but can be tailored to
    # suit specific needs.
