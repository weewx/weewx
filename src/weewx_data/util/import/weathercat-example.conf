# Specify the source. Available options are:
#   CSV - import obs from a single CSV format file
#   WU - import obs from a Weather Underground PWS history
#   Cumulus - import obs from a one or more Cumulus monthly log files
#   WD - import obs from a one or more WD monthly log files
#   WeatherCat - import obs from one or more WeatherCat monthly .cat files
# Format is:
#   source = (CSV | WU | Cumulus | WD | WeatherCat)
source = WeatherCat

[WeatherCat]
    # Parameters used when importing WeatherCat monthly .cat files
    #
    # Directory containing WeatherCat year folders that contain the monthly
    # .cat files to be imported. Format is:
    #   directory = full path without trailing /
    directory = /var/tmp

    # Specify the character used as the decimal point. WeatherCat monthly .cat
    # files may not always use a period as the decimal point. The character
    # must be enclosed in quotes. Format is:
    #   decimal = '.'
    # Default is '.' (period).
    decimal = '.'

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.
    # Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when there are no missing
    #            records from period being imported. Missing records will
    #            cause the interval field to be incorrectly calculated for some
    #            records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX or some other means with the same archive interval as
    #            set in weewx.conf on this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of 'x' minutes for every record where 'x'
    #            is a number. This setting is best used if the records to be
    #            imported are equally spaced in time but there are some missing
    #            records.
    # To import WeatherCat records it is recommended the interval setting be
    # set to the Sampling Rate setting used by WeatherCat as set on the Misc2
    # tab under WeatherCat Preferences unless the Adaptive Sampling Rate was
    # used in which case interval = derive should be used.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    interval = x

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    # Default is True.
    calc_missing = True

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of tranche
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    # Default is 250.
    tranche = 250

    # Map WeatherCat fields to WeeWX archive fields. Format for each map entry
    # is:
    #
    #   [[[weewx_archive_field_name]]]
    #       source_field = wcat_field_name
    #       unit = weewx_unit_name
    #       is_cumulative = True | False
    #       is_text = True | False
    #
    # where:
    #   weewx_archive_field_name - An observation name in the WeeWX database
    #                              schema.
    #   source_field             - Config option specifying the WeatherCat
    #                              field being mapped.
    #   wcat_field_name          - The name of a field from the WeatherCat log
    #                              file.
    #   unit                     - Config option specifying the unit used by
    #                              the WeatherCat field being mapped.
    #   weewx_unit_name          - The WeeWX unit name for the the units used
    #                              by wcat_field_name.
    #   is_cumulative            - Config option specifying whether the
    #                              WeatherCat field being mapped is cumulative,
    #                              e.g: dayrain. Optional, default value is
    #                              False.
    #   is_text                  - Config option specifying whether the
    #                              WeatherCat field being mapped is text.
    #                              Optional, default value is False.
    # For example,
    #   [[[outTemp]]]
    #       source_field = T
    #       unit = degree_C
    # would map the WeatherCat field 'T', in degrees C, to the WeeWX archive
    # field 'outTemp'.
    #
    # An example field map stanza is provided below. Once the units are
    # adjusted this field map should suit most users but can be tailored to
    # suit specific needs.
