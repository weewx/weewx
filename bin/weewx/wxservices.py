        Directives look like:

           obs_type = [prefer_hardware|hardware|software], [loop|archive]

        where:

        obs_type is an observation type to be calculated, such as 'heatindex'

        The choice [prefer_hardware|hardware|software] determines how the value is to be
        calculated. Option "prefer_hardware" means that if the hardware supplies a value, it will
        be used, otherwise the value will be calculated in software.

        The choice [loop|archive] indicates whether the calculation is to be done for only LOOP
        packets, or only archive records. If left out, it will be done for both.

        Examples:

            cloudbase = software,loop
        The derived type 'cloudbase' will always be calculated in software, but only for LOOP
        packets

            cloudbase = software, record
        The derived type 'cloudbase' will always be calculated in software, but only for archive
        records.

            cloudbase = software
        The derived type 'cloudbase' will always be calculated in software, for both LOOP packets
