"""Import weewx observation data from an external source.

Compatibility:

   wee_import can import from a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format file,
   directly from the historical records of a Weather Underground Personal
   Weather Station or from one or more Cumulus monthly log files. CSV format
   files must have a comma separated list of field names on the first line.

Design

   wee_import utilises a config file (the import config file) and a number of
   command line options to control the import. The config file defines the type
   of input to be performed and the import data source as well as more advanced
   options such as field maps etc. Details of the supported command line
   parameters/options can be viewed by entering wee_import --help at the command
   line. Details of the wee_import config file settings can be found in example
   import config files distributed in the weewx/util/import directory.

   wee_import utilises an abstract base class Source that defines the majority
   of the wee_import functionality. The abstract base class and other supporting
   structures are in bin/weeimport/weeimport.py. Child classes are created from
   the base class for each different import type supported by wee_import. The
   child classes set a number of import type specific properties as well as
   defining a getData() method that reads the raw data to be imported and a
   period_generator() method that generates a sequence of objects to be imported
   (eg monthly log files). This way wee_import can be extended to support other
   sources by defining a new child class, its specific properties as well as
   getData() and period_generator() methods. The child class for a given import
   type are definined in the bin/weeimport/xxximport.py files.

   As with other weewx utilities, wee_import advises the user of basic
   configuration, action taken and results via stdout. However, since
   wee_import can make substantial changes to the weewx archive, wee_import also
   logs to file by default. This functionality is controlled via a command
   line option.

Prerequisites

   wee_import uses a number of weewx API calls and therefore must have a
   functional weewx installation. wee_import requires weewx 3.6.0 or later.

Configuration

   A number of parameters can be defined in the import config file as follows:

# Specify the source. Available options are:

#   WU - import obs from a Weather Underground PWS history

[CSV]
    # Parameters used when importing from a CSV file

    # Path and name of our CSV source file. Format is:
    #   file = full path and filename
    file = /var/tmp/data.csv

    # If there is no mapped interval field how will the interval field be
    # determined for the imported records. Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            weewx using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of x minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #
    # Note: If there is a mapped interval field then this setting will be
    #       ignored.

    #           UV fields will be set to None/NULL.
    # For a CSV import UV_sensor should be set to False if a UV sensor was

Adding a New Import Source

    To add a new import source:

    -   Create a new file bin/weeimport/xxximport.py that defines a new class
        for the xxx source that is a child of class Source. The new class must
        meet the following minimum requirements:

        -   __init__() must define:

            -   self.raw_datetime_format: Format of date time data field from
                                          which observation timestamp is to be
                                          derived. String comprising Python
                                          strptime() format codes.
            -   self.rain: Whether imported rainfall field contains the
                           rainfall since the last record or a cumulative value.
                           String 'discrete' or 'cumulative'
            -   self.wind_dir: The range of values in degrees that will be
                               accepted as a valid wind direction. Two way
                               tuple of the format (lower, upper) where lower
                               is the lower inclusive limit and upper is the
                               upper inclusive limit.

        -   Define a period_generator() method that:

            -   Accepts no parameters and generates (yields) a sequence of
                objects (eg file names, dates for a http request etc) that are
                passed to the getRawData() method to obtain a sequence of raw
                data records.

        -   Define a getRawdata() method that:

            -   Accepts a single parameter 'period' that is provided by the
                period_generator() method.

            -   Returns an iterable of raw source data records.

            -   Creates the source data field-to-weewx archive field map and
                saves the map to the class object map property (the map may be
                created using the Source.parseMap() method). Refer to
                getRawData() methods in csvimport.py and wuimport.py.

    -   Modify bin/weeimport/weeimport.py as follows:

        -   Add a new entry to the list of supported services defined in
            SUPPORTED_SERVICES.

    -   Create a wee_import import config file for importing from the new
        source. The import config file must:

        -   Add a new source name to the source parameter. The new source name
            must be the same (case sensitive) as the entry added to
            weeimport.py SUPPORTED_SERVICES.

        -   Define a stanza for the new import type. The stanza must be the
            same (case sensitive) as the entry added to weeimport.py
            SUPPORTED_SERVICES.
