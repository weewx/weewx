"""Import WeeWX observation data from an external source.

Compatibility:

    wee_import can import from:
        - a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format file
        - the historical records of a Weather Underground Personal
          Weather Station
        - one or more Cumulus monthly log files
        - one or more Weather Display monthly log files

Design

    wee_import utilises an import config file and a number of command line
    options to control the import. The import config file defines the type of
    input to be performed and the import data source as well as more advanced
    options such as field maps etc. Details of the supported command line
    parameters/options can be viewed by entering wee_import --help at the
    command line. Details of the wee_import import config file settings can be
    found in the example import config files distributed in the
    weewx/util/import directory.

    wee_import utilises an abstract base class Source that defines the majority
    of the wee_import functionality. The abstract base class and other
    supporting structures are in bin/weeimport/weeimport.py. Child classes are
    created from the base class for each different import type supported by
    wee_import. The child classes set a number of import type specific
    properties as well as defining getData() and period_generator() methods that
    read the raw data to be imported and generates a sequence of objects to be
    imported (eg monthly log files) respectively. This way wee_import can be
    extended to support other sources by defining a new child class, its
    specific properties as well as getData() and period_generator() methods. The
    child class for a given import type are defined in the
    bin/weeimport/xxximport.py files.

    As with other WeeWX utilities, wee_import advises the user of basic
    configuration, action taken and results via the console. However, since
    wee_import can make substantial changes to the WeeWX archive, wee_import
    also logs to WeeWX log system file. Console and log output can be controlled
    via a number of command line options.

Prerequisites

    wee_import uses a number of WeeWX API calls and therefore must have a
    functional WeeWX installation. wee_import requires WeeWX 4.0.0 or later.

Configuration

    A number of parameters can be defined in the import config file as follows:

[CSV]
    # Parameters used when importing from a CSV file

    # Path and name of our CSV source file. Format is:
    #   file = full path and filename
    file = /var/tmp/data.csv

    # If there is no mapped interval field how will the interval field be
    # determined for the imported records. Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of x minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #
    # Note: If there is a mapped interval field then this setting will be

    # How will the interval field be determined for the imported records.
    # Available options are:
    #   derive - Derive the interval field from the timestamp of successive
    #            records. This setting is best used when the imported records
    #            are equally spaced in time and there are no missing records.
    #   conf   - Use the interval setting from weewx.conf. This setting is
    #            best used if the records to be imported have been produced by
    #            WeeWX using the same archive interval as set in weewx.conf on
    #            this machine.
    #   x      - Use a fixed interval of x minutes for every record. This
    #            setting is best used if the records to be imported are
    #            equally based in time but there are some missing records.
    #            This setting is recommended for WU imports.
    # To import WD records it is recommended that the interval setting be set to
    # the value used in WD as the 'data log interval'.
    # Format is:
    #   interval = (derive | conf | x)
    interval = x

    # Should the [StdQC] max/min limits in weewx.conf be applied to the
    # imported data. This may be useful if the source has extreme values that
    # are clearly incorrect for some observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are applied.
    #   False - weewx.conf [StdQC] max/min limits are not applied.
    # Format is:
    #   qc = (True | False)
    qc = True

    # Should any missing derived observations be calculated from the imported
    # data if possible. Available options are:
    #   True  - Any missing derived observations are calculated.
    #   False - Any missing derived observations are not calculated.
    # Format is:
    #   calc_missing = (True | False)
    calc_missing = True

    # Specify the character used as the field delimiter as WD monthly log files
    # may not always use a comma to delimit fields in the monthly log files. The
    # character must be enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same as the decimal
    # setting below. Format is:
    #   delimiter = ','
    delimiter = ','

    # Specify the character used as the decimal point. WD monthly log file may
    # not always use a full stop character as the decimal point. The character
    # must be enclosed in quotes. Must not be the same as the delimiter setting.
    # Format is:
    #   decimal = '.'
    decimal = '.'

    # Imported records are written to archive in transactions of tranche
    # records at a time. Increase for faster throughput, decrease to reduce
    # memory requirements. Format is:
    #   tranche = x
    # where x is an integer
    tranche = 250

    # Specify whether a UV sensor was used to produce any UV observations.
    # Available options are:
    #   True  - UV sensor was used and UV data will be imported.
    #   False - UV sensor was not used and any UV data will not be imported.
    #           UV fields will be set to None/NULL.
    # For a Cumulus monthly log file import UV_sensor should be set to False if
    # a UV sensor was NOT present when the import data was created. Otherwise
    # it may be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   UV_sensor = (True | False)
    UV_sensor = True

    # Specify whether a solar radiation sensor was used to produce any solar
    # radiation observations. Available options are:
    #   True  - Solar radiation sensor was used and solar radiation data will
    #           be imported.
    #   False - Solar radiation sensor was not used and any solar radiation
    #           data will not be imported. radiation fields will be set to
    #           None/NULL.
    # For a Cumulus monthly log file import solar_sensor should be set to False
    # if a solar radiation sensor was NOT present when the import data was
    # created. Otherwise it may be set to True or omitted. Format is:
    #   solar_sensor = (True | False)
    solar_sensor = True

    # For correct import of the monthly logs wee_import needs to know what
    # units are used in the imported data. The units used for temperature,
    # pressure, rain and wind speed related observations in the Cumulus monthly
    # logs are set at the Cumulus Station Configuration Screen.  The
    # [[Units]] settings below should be set to the WeeWX equivalent of the
    # units of measure used by Cumulus (eg if Cumulus used 'C' for temperature,
    # temperature should be set to 'degree_C'). Note that Cumulus does not
    # support all units used by WeeWX (eg 'mmHg') so not all WeeWX units are
    # available options.
    [[Units]]
        temperature = degree_C      # options are 'degree_F' or 'degree_C'
        pressure    = hPa           # options are 'inHg', 'mbar' or 'hPa'
        rain        = mm            # options are 'inch' or 'mm'
        speed       = km_per_hour   # options are 'mile_per_hour',
                                    # 'km_per_hour', 'knot' or

Adding a New Import Source

    To add a new import source:

    -   Create a new file bin/weeimport/xxximport.py that defines a new class
        for the xxx source that is a child of class Source. The new class must
        meet the following minimum requirements:

        -   __init__() must define:

            -   self.raw_datetime_format: Format of date time data field from
                                          which observation timestamp is to be
                                          derived. String comprising Python
                                          strptime() format codes.
            -   self.rain: Whether imported rainfall field contains the
                           rainfall since the last record or a cumulative value.
                           String 'discrete' or 'cumulative'
            -   self.wind_dir: The range of values in degrees that will be
                               accepted as a valid wind direction. Two way
                               tuple of the format (lower, upper) where lower
                               is the lower inclusive limit and upper is the
                               upper inclusive limit.

        -   Define a period_generator() method that:

            -   Accepts no parameters and generates (yields) a sequence of
                objects (eg file names, dates for a http request etc) that are
                passed to the getRawData() method to obtain a sequence of raw
                data records.

        -   Define a getRawdata() method that:

            -   Accepts a single parameter 'period' that is provided by the
                period_generator() method.

            -   Returns an iterable of raw source data records.

            -   Creates the source data field-to-WeeWX archive field map and
                saves the map to the class object map property (the map may be
                created using the Source.parseMap() method). Refer to
                getRawData() methods in csvimport.py and wuimport.py.

    -   Modify bin/weeimport/weeimport.py as follows:

        -   Add a new entry to the list of supported services defined in
            SUPPORTED_SERVICES.

    -   Create a wee_import import config file for importing from the new
        source. The import config file must:

        -   Add a new source name to the source parameter. The new source name
            must be the same (case sensitive) as the entry added to
            weeimport.py SUPPORTED_SERVICES.

        -   Define a stanza for the new import type. The stanza must be the
            same (case sensitive) as the entry added to weeimport.py
            SUPPORTED_SERVICES.
