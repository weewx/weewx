        <p>This guide is intended for developers contributing to the open source project WeeWX.
        </p>


        <h1>Goals</h1>

        <p>The primary design goals of WeeWX are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Architectural simplicity. No semaphores, no named pipes, no inter-process communications, no complex
                multi-threading to manage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extensibility. Make it easy for the user to add new features or to modify existing features.
            </li>
            <li>
                &quot;Fast enough&quot; In any design decision, architectural simplicity and elegance trump speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                One code base. A single code base should be used for all platforms, all weather stations, all reports,
                and any combination of features. Ample configuration and customization options should be provided so the
                user does not feel tempted to start hacking code. At worse, the user may have to subclass, which is much
                easier to port to newer versions of the code base, than customizing the base code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Minimal dependencies. The code should rely on a minimal number of external packages, so the user does
                not have to go chase them down all over the Web before getting started.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simple data model. The implementation should use a very simple data model that is likely to support many
                different types of hardware.
            </li>
            <li>
                A &quot;pythonic&quot; code base. The code should be written in a style that others will recognize.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Strategies</h1>

        <p>To meet these goals, the following strategies were used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A &quot;micro-kernel&quot; design. The WeeWX engine actually does very little. Its primary job is to
                load and run <em> services</em> at runtime, making it easy for users to add or subtract features.
            </li>
            <li>
                A largely stateless design style. For example, many of the processing routines read the data they need
                directly from the database, rather than caching it and sharing with other routines. While this means the
                same data may be read multiple times, it also means the only point of possible cache incoherence is
                through the database, where transactions are easily controlled. This greatly reduces the chances of
                corrupting the data, making it much easier to understand and modify the code base.
            </li>
            <li>
                Isolated data collection and archiving. The code for collecting and archiving data run in a single
                thread that is simple enough that it is unlikely to crash. The report processing is where most mistakes
                are likely to happen, so isolate that in a separate thread. If it crashes, it will not affect the main
                data thread.
            </li>
            <li>
                A powerful configuration parser. The <a href="https://configobj.readthedocs.io">ConfigObj</a> module, by
                Michael Foord and Nicola Larosa, was chosen to read the configuration file. This allows many options
                that might otherwise have to go in the code, to be in a configuration file.
            </li>
            <li>
                A powerful templating engine. The <a href="https://cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a> module was chosen
                for generating html and other types of files from templates. Cheetah allows <em>search list
                extensions</em> to be defined, making it easy to extend WeeWX with new template tags.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pure Python. The code base is 100% Python &mdash; no underlying C libraries need be built to install
                WeeWX. This also means no Makefiles are needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While WeeWX is nowhere near as fast at generating images and HTML as its predecessor, <span class="code">wview</span>
            (this is partially because WeeWX uses fancier fonts and a much more powerful templating engine), it is fast
            enough for all platforms but the slowest. I run it regularly on a 500 MHz machine where generating the 9
            images used in the &quot;Current Conditions&quot; page takes just under 2 seconds (compared with 0.4 seconds
            for <span class="code">wview</span>).
        </p>

        <p>
            All writes to the databases are protected by transactions. You can kill the program at any time (either
            Control-C if run directly or &quot;<span class="code">/etc/init.d/weewx
            stop</span>&quot; if run as a daemon) without fear of corrupting the databases.
        </p>

        <p>
            The code makes ample use of exceptions to insure graceful recovery from problems such as network outages. It
            also monitors socket and console timeouts, restarting whatever it was working on several times before giving
            up. In the case of an unrecoverable console error (such as the console not responding at all), the program
            waits 60 seconds then restarts the program from the top.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any &quot;hard&quot; exceptions, that is those that do not involve network and console timeouts and are most
            likely due to a logic error, are logged, reraised, and ultimately cause thread termination. If this happens
            in the main thread (not likely due to its simplicity), then this causes program termination. If it happens
            in the report processing thread (much more likely), then only the generation of reports will be affected
            &mdash; the main thread will continue downloading data off the instrument and putting them in the database.
        </p>


        <h1>Units</h1>

        <p>
            In general, there are three different areas where the unit system makes a difference:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                On the weather station hardware. Different manufacturers use different unit systems for their hardware.
                The Davis Vantage series use U.S. Customary units exclusively, Fine Offset and LaCrosse stations use
                metric, while Oregon Scientific, Peet Bros, and Hideki stations use a mishmash of US and metric.
            </li>
            <li>In the database. Either US or Metric can be used.</li>
            <li>In the presentation (i.e., html and image files).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The general strategy is that measurements are converted by service <span class="code">StdConvert</span> as
            they come off the weather station into a target unit system, then stored internally in the database in that
            unit system. Then, as they come off the database to be used for a report, they are converted into a target
            unit, specified by a combination of the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> and
            the skin configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
        </p>

        <h1 id="value_None">Value &quot;<span class="code">None</span>&quot;</h1>

        <p>
            The Python special value <span class="code">None</span> is used throughout to signal an invalid or bad data
            point. All functions must be written to expect it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Device drivers should be written to emit <span class="code">None</span> if a data value is bad (perhaps
            because of a failed checksum). If the hardware simply doesn't support a data type, then the driver should
            not emit a value at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            The same rule applies to derived values. If the input data for a derived value are missing, then no derived
            value should be emitted. However, if the input values are present, but have value <span
            class="code">None</span>, then the derived value should be set to <span class="code">None</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the time value must never be <span class="code">None</span>. This is because it is used as the
            primary key in the SQL database.
        </p>

        <h1>Time</h1>

        <p>
            WeeWX stores all data in UTC (roughly, &quot;Greenwich&quot; or &quot;Zulu&quot;) time. However, usually one
            is interested in weather events in local time and want image and HTML generation to reflect that.
            Furthermore, most weather stations are configured in local time. This requires that many data times be
            converted back and forth between UTC and local time. To avoid tripping up over time zones and daylight
            savings time, WeeWX generally uses Python routines to do this conversion. Nowhere in the code base is there
            any explicit recognition of DST. Instead, its presence is implicit in the conversions. At times, this can
            cause the code to be relatively inefficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if one wanted to plot something every 3 hours in UTC time, it would be very simple: to get the
            next plot point, just add 10,800 to the epoch time:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">next_ts = last_ts + 10800 </pre>
        <p>
            But, if one wanted to plot something for every 3 hours <em>in local time</em> (that is, at 0000, 0300, 0600,
            etc.), despite a possible DST change in the middle, then things get a bit more complicated. One could modify
            the above to recognize whether a DST transition occurs sometime between <span class="code">last_ts</span>
            and the next three hours and, if so, make the necessary adjustments. This is generally what <span
                class="code">wview</span> does. WeeWX takes a different approach and converts from UTC to local, does
            the arithmetic, then converts back. This is inefficient, but bulletproof against changes in DST algorithms,
            etc:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">time_dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(last_ts)
delta = datetime.timedelta(seconds=10800)
next_dt = time_dt + delta
next_ts = int(time.mktime(next_dt.timetuple()))</pre>
        <p>Other time conversion problems are handled in a similar manner.</p>
        <p>
            For astronomical calculations, WeeWX uses the latitude and longitude specified in the configuration file. If
            that location does not correspond to the computer's local time, reports with astronomical times will
            probably be incorrect.
        </p>

        <h2>Archive records</h2>
        <p>
            An archive record's timestamp, whether in software or in the database, represents the <em>end time</em> of
            the record. For example, a record timestamped 05-Feb-2016 09:35, includes data from an instant after 09:30,
            through 09:35. Another way to think of it is that it is exclusive on the left, inclusive on the right.
            Schematically:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">09:30 < dateTime <= 09:35</pre>
        <p>
            Database queries should reflect this. For example, to find the maximum temperature for the hour between
            timestamps 1454691600 and 1454695200, the query would be:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">SELECT MAX(outTemp) FROM archive WHERE dateTime > 1454691600 and dateTime <= 1454695200;</pre>
        <p>
            This ensures that the record at the beginning of the hour (1454691600) does not get included (it belongs to
            the previous hour), while the record at the end of the hour (1454695200) does.
        </p>
        <p>
            One must be constantly be aware of this convention when working with timestamped data records.
        </p>

        <p>
            Better yet, if you need this kind of information, use an
            <a href="https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/WeeWX-V4-user-defined-types">xtypes</a> call:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
max_temp = weewx.xtypes.get_aggregate('outTemp',
                                      (1454691600, 1454695200),
                                      'max',
                                      db_manager)
</pre>
        <p>
            It will not only make sure the limits of the query are correct, but will also decide whether or not
            the daily summary optimization can be used (<a href="#Daily_summaries">details below</a>). If not, it will
            use the regular archive table.
        </p>

        <h1>Internationalization</h1>
        <p>
            Generally, WeeWX is locale aware. It will emit reports using the local formatting conventions for date,
            times, and values.
        </p>

        <h1>Exceptions</h1>
        <p>In general, your code should not simply swallow an exception. For example, this is bad form:</p>
        <pre class="tty">
    try:
        os.rename(oldname, newname)
    except:
        pass</pre>
        <p>
            While the odds are that if an exception happens it will be because the file <span class="code">oldname</span>
            does not exist, that is not guaranteed. It could be because of a keyboard interrupt, or a corrupted file
            system, or something else. Instead, you should test explicitly for any expected exception, and let the rest
            go by:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
    try:
        os.rename(oldname, newname)
    except OSError:
        pass</pre>
        <p>
            WeeWX has a few specialized exception types, used to rationalized all the different types of exceptions that
            could be thrown by the underlying libraries. In particular, low-level I/O code can raise a myriad of
            exceptions, such as USB errors, serial errors, network connectivity errors, <i>etc.</i> All device drivers
            should catch these exceptions and convert them into an exception of type <span
                class="code">WeeWxIOError</span> or one of its subclasses.
        </p>

        <h1>Naming conventions</h1>
        <p>
            How you name variables makes a big difference in code readability. In general, long names are preferable to
            short names. Instead of this,
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">p = 990.1</pre>
        <p>use this,</p>
        <pre class="tty">pressure = 990.1</pre>
        <p>or, even better, this:</p>
        <pre class="tty">pressure_mbar = 990.1</pre>

        <p>
            WeeWX uses a number of conventions to signal the variable type, although they are not used consistently.
        </p>

        <h1>Code style</h1>
        <p>
            Generally, we try to follow the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8 style guide</a>,
            but there are <em>many</em> exceptions. In particular, many older WeeWX function names use camelCase, but
            PEP 8 calls for snake_case. Please use snake_case for new code.

        <p>
            Most modern code editors, such as Eclipse, or PyCharm, have the ability to automatically format code. Resist
            the temptation and <em>don't use this feature!</em> Two reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unless all developers use the same tool, using the same settings, we will just thrash back and forth
                between slightly different versions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automatic formatters play a useful role, but some of what they do are really trivial changes, such as
                removing spaces in otherwise blank lines. Now if someone is trying to figure out what real, syntactic,
                changes you have made, s/he will have to wade through all those extraneous "changed lines," trying to
                find the important stuff.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you are working with a file where the formatting is so ragged that you really must do a reformat, then do
            it as a separate commit. This allows the formatting changes to be clearly distinguished from more functional
            changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            When invoking functions or instantiating classes, use the fully qualified name. Don't do this:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty" style="opacity: 0.5">from datetime import datetime
now = datetime()</pre>
        <p>Instead, do this:</p>
        <pre class="tty">import datetime
now = datetime.datetime()</pre>

            We generally follow Vincent Driessen's <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">branching
            model</a>. Ignore the complicated diagram at the beginning of the article, and just focus on the text. In
            this model, there are two key branches:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="code">master</span>. Fixes go into this branch. We tend to use fewer "hot fix" branches
                and, instead, just incorporate any fixes directly into the branch. Releases are tagged relative to this
                branch.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">development</span> (called <span class="code">develop</span> in Vince's article).
                This is where new features go. Before a release, they will be merged into the <span
                class="code">master</span> branch.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            What this means to you is that if you submit a pull request that includes a new feature, make sure you
            commit your changes relative to the <span class="code"><em>development</em></span> branch. If it is just a
            bug fix, it should be committed against the <span class="code">master</span> branch.

        <h1 id="Daily_summaries">Daily summaries</h1>

        <p>
            This section builds on the discussion <a href="customizing.htm#The_database"><em>The database</em></a> in
            the <em>Customizing Guide</em>. Read it first.
        </p>
        <p>
            The big flat table in the database (usually called table <span class="code">archive</span>) is the
            definitive table of record. While it includes a lot of information, querying it can be slow. For example, to
            find the maximum temperature of the year would require scanning the whole thing, which might include 100,000
            or more records. To speed things up, WeeWX includes <em>daily summaries</em> in the database as an
            optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the daily summaries, each observation type gets its own table, which holds a statistical summary for the
            day. For example, for outside temperature (observation type <span class="code">outTemp</span>), this table
            would be named <span class="code">archive_day_outTemp</span>. Here's what it would look like:

        <p>
            Now consider an extensive variable such as <span class="code">rain</span>. The total rainfall for the day
            will be given by the field <span class="code">sum</span>. So, calculating the total rainfall for the year
            can be done by scanning and summing only 365 records, instead of potentially tens, or even hundreds, of
            thousands of records. This results in a dramatic speed up for report generation, particularly on slower
            machines such as the Raspberry Pi, working off an SD card.
