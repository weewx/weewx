        <p>This guide is intended for developers contributing to the open source project weeWX.
        </p>


        <h1>Goals</h1>

        <p>The primary design goals of weeWX are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Architectural simplicity. No semaphores, no named pipes, no
                inter-process communications, no complex multi-threading to
                manage.
            </li>
            <li>Extensibility. Make it easy for the user to add new features or to modify existing features.
            </li>
            <li>&quot;Fast enough&quot; In any design decision, architectural simplicity and elegance trump speed.
            </li>
            <li>One code base. A single code base should be used for all platforms, all weather stations, all reports,
                and any combination of features. Ample configuration and customization options should be provided so the
                user does not feel tempted to start hacking code. At worse, the user may have to subclass, which is much
                easier to port to newer versions of the code base, than customizing the base code.
            </li>
            <li>Minimal dependencies. The code should rely on a minimal
                number of external packages, so the user does not have to go
                chase them down all over the Web before getting started.
            </li>
            <li>Simple data model. The implementation should use a very
                simple data model that is likely to support many different
                types of hardware.
            </li>
            <li>A &quot;pythonic&quot; code base. The code should be written
                so others will find idioms that they recognize.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Strategies</h1>

        <p>To meet these goals, the following strategies were used: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A &quot;micro-kernel&quot; design. The weeWX engine actually does very little.
                Its primary job is to load and run <em> services</em> at runtime, making it easy for users to add or
                subtract features.
            </li>
            <li>A largely stateless design style. For example, many of the processing routines read the data they need
                directly from the database, rather than caching it and sharing with other routines. While this means the
                same data may be read multiple times, it also means the only point of possible cache incoherence is
                through the database, where transactions are easily controlled. This greatly reduces the chances of
                corrupting the data, making it much easier to understand and modify the code base.
            </li>
            <li>Isolated data collection and archiving. The code for
                collecting and archiving data run in a single thread that is
                simple enough that it is unlikely to crash. The report
                processing is where most mistakes are likely to happen, so
                isolate that in a separate thread. If it crashes, it will not
                affect the main data thread.
            </li>
            <li>A powerful configuration parser. The
                <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html">ConfigObj</a> module, by Michael Foord and
                Nicola
                Larosa, was chosen to read the configuration file. This allows many options that might otherwise have to
                go in the code to go instead in a configuration file.
            </li>
            <li>A powerful templating engine. The
                <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a> module
                was chosen for generating html and other types of files from
                templates. Cheetah
                allows <em>search list extensions</em> to be defined, making it easy to extend weeWX with new template
                tags. Unfortunately, as of 2016, Cheetah has not been updated in many years (indeed, the Cheetah website
                seems to be dead). Fortunately, Cheetah seems to be very robust, with only a few well-known bugs that
                are easiy worked around, so we will likely continue to use it for the foreseeable future.
            </li>
            <li>Pure Python. The code base is 100% Python &mdash; no underlying C libraries need be built to install
                weeWX. This also means no Makefiles are needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While weeWX is nowhere near as fast at generating images and HTML as its
            predecessor, <span class="code">wview</span> (this is partially because weeWX uses
            fancier fonts and a much more powerful templating engine), it is fast enough for all platforms but the
            slowest. I run it regularly on a 500 MHz machine where generating the 9 images used in the &quot;Current
            Conditions&quot; page takes just under 2 seconds (compared with 0.4 seconds for <span
                    class="code">wview</span>). </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the architectural goal of one code base is likely to be broken with the arrival of Python
            V3.X. It has so many changes that are not backwards compatible with V2.X, that a separate code base will
            most likely be needed. My intention is to stick with the V2.X versions until V3.X is so widespread it cannot
            be ignored, then make a permanent switch. Given the slow adoption rate of V3.X this is unlikely to happen
            anytime soon. In any case, I doubt the transition will affect the average weeWX
            user. </p>

        <p>All writes to the databases are protected by transactions. You can kill the program at any time (either
            Control-C if run directly or &quot;<span class="code">/etc/init.d/weewx
        stop</span>&quot; if run as a daemon) without fear of corrupting the databases. </p>

        <p>The code makes ample use of exceptions to insure graceful recovery from problems such as network outages. It
            also monitors socket and console timeouts, restarting whatever it was working on several times before giving
            up. In the case of an unrecoverable console error (such as the console not responding at all), the program
            waits 60 seconds then restarts the program from the top.</p>

        <p>Any &quot;hard&quot; exceptions, that is those that do not involve network and console timeouts and are most
            likely due to a logic error, are logged, reraised, and ultimately cause thread termination. If this happens
            in the main thread (not likely due to its simplicity), then this causes program termination. If it happens
            in the report processing thread (much more likely), then only the generation of reports will be
            affected &mdash; the main thread will continue downloading data off the instrument and putting them in the
            database. You can fix the problem at your leisure, without worrying about losing any data. </p>

        <h1>Units</h1>

        <p>In general, there are three different areas where the unit system makes a difference: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the weather station hardware. Different manufacturers use different unit systems for their hardware.
                The Davis Vantage series use U.S. Customary units exclusively, Fine Offset and LaCrosse stations use
                metric, while Oregon Scientific, Peet Bros, and Hideki stations use a mishmash of US and metric.
            </li>
            <li>In the database. Either US or Metric can be used.</li>
            <li>In the presentation (i.e., html and image files).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The general strategy is that measurements are converted by service <span class="code">StdConvert</span> as
            they come off the weather station into a target unit system, then stored internally in the database in that
            unit system. Then, as they come off the database to be used for a report, they are converted into a target
            unit, specified by the skin. </p>

        <h1>Value &quot;<span class="code">None</span>&quot;</h1>

        <p>The Python special value <span class="code">None</span> is used throughout to signal a missing data point.
            All functions must be written to expect it. </p>

        <p>Device drivers should be written to emit <span class="code">None</span> if a data value is bad (perhaps
            because of a failed checksum). If the hardware simply doesn't support it, then the driver should not emit a
            value at all.</p>

        <p>However, the time value must never be <span class="code">None</span>. This is because it is used as the
            primary key in the SQL database. </p>

        <h1>Time</h1>

        <p>WeeWX stores all data in UTC (roughly, &quot;Greenwich&quot; or &quot;Zulu&quot;)
            time. However, usually one is interested in weather events in local time and want image and HTML generation
            to reflect that. Furthermore, most weather stations are configured in local time. This requires that many
            data times be converted back and forth between UTC and local time. To avoid tripping up over time zones and
            daylight savings time, weeWX generally uses Python routines to do this conversion.
            Nowhere in the code base is there any explicit recognition of DST. Instead, its presence is implicit in the
            conversions. At times, this can cause the code to be relatively inefficient. </p>

        <p>For example, if one wanted to plot something every 3 hours in UTC time, it would be very simple: to get the
            next plot point, just add 10,800 to the epoch time: </p>
        <pre class="tty">next_ts = last_ts + 10800 </pre>
        <p>But, if one wanted to plot something for every 3 hours <em>in local time</em> (that is, at 0000, 0300, 0600,
            etc.), despite a possible DST change in the middle, then things get a bit more complicated. One could modify
            the above to recognize whether a DST transition occurs sometime between <span class="code">last_ts</span>
            and the next three hours and, if so, make the necessary adjustments. This is generally what <span
                    class="code">wview</span> does. WeeWX takes a different approach and
            converts from UTC to local, does the arithmetic, then converts back. This is inefficient, but bulletproof
            against changes in DST algorithms, etc: </p>
        <pre class="tty">time_dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(last_ts)
delta = datetime.timedelta(seconds=10800)
next_dt = time_dt + delta
next_ts = int(time.mktime(next_dt.timetuple()))</pre>
        <p>Other time conversion problems are handled in a similar manner. </p>

        <h1>Internationalization</h1>
        <p>Generally, weewx does not make much use of Unicode. This is because the Python 2.x libraries do not always
            handle it correctly. In particular, the function <span class="code">time.strftime()</span> completely fails
            when handed a Unicode string with a non-ASCII character. As this function is often used by extensions,
            working around this bug is an unfair expectation on extension writers. So, we generally avoid Unicode.</p>
        <p>Instead, weeWX mostly uses regular strings, with any non-ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8. </p>
        <p>An exception to this general rule is the image generator, which holds labels internally in Unicode, because
            that is the encoding expected by most fonts.</p>
        <p>The document <i><a
                href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">The
            Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character
            Sets</a></i> by Joel Spolsky, is highly recommended if you are just starting to work with UTF-8 and Unicode.
        </p>

        <h1>Exceptions</h1>
        <p>In general, your code should not simply swallow an exception. For example, this is bad form:</p>
        <pre class="tty">
    try:
        os.rename(oldname, newname)
    except:
        pass</pre>
        <p>While the odds are that if an exception happens it will be because the file <span class="code">oldname</span>
            does not exist, that is not guaranteed. It could be because of a keyboard interrupt, or a corrupted file
            system, or something else. Instead, you should test explicitly for any expected exception, and let the rest
            go by:</p>
        <pre class="tty">
    try:
        os.rename(oldname, newname)
    except OSError:
        pass</pre>
        <p>WeeWX has a few specialized exception types, used to rationalized all the different types of exceptions that
            could be thrown by the underlying libraries. In particular, low-level I/O code can raise a myriad of
            exceptions, such as USB errors, serial errors, network connectivity errors, <i>etc.</i> All device drivers
            should catch these exceptions and convert them into an exception of type <span
                    class="code">WeeWxIOError</span> or one of its subclasses.</p>

        <h1>Code style</h1>
        <p>Generally, we try to follow the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8 style guide</a>,
            but there are <em>many</em> exceptions. In particular, many older weeWX function names use camelCase, but
            PEP 8 calls for snake_case. Please use snake_case for new code.</p>
        <p>Most modern code editors, such as Eclipse, or PyCharm, have the ability to automatically format code.
            Resist the temptation and <em>don't use this feature!</em> Two reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless all developers use the same tool, using the same settings, we will just thrash back and
                forth between slightly different versions.
            </li>
            <li>Automatic formatters play a useful role, but some of what they do are really trivial changes,
                such as removing spaces in otherwise blank lines. Now if someone is trying to figure out what
                real, syntactic changes you have made, s/he will have to wade through all those
                extraneous "changed lines," trying to find the important stuff.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>When invoking functions or instantiating classes, use the fully qualified name. Don't do this:</p>
        <pre class="tty" style="opacity: 0.5">from datetime import dt
now = dt()</pre>
        <p>Instead, do this:</p>
        <pre class="tty">import datetime
now = datetime.datetime()</pre>
