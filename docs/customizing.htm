      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This document covers the customization of <span class="code">weewx</span>.
        It assumes that you have read and are reasonably familiar with the <a href="usersguide.htm">Users
          Guide</a>. </p>
      <p>It starts with an overview of the architecture of weewx. If you are
        only interested in customizing the generated reports you can probably
        skip the overview and proceed directly to the section <em> <a href="#standard_skin">The
            Standard skin configuration file</a></em>. With this approach you
        can easily add new plot images, change the titles of images, change the
        units used in the reports, and so on. </p>
      <p>However, if your goal is a specialized application, such as adding
        alarms, RSS feeds, etc., then it would be worth your while to read about
        the internal architecture and how to customize it. </p>
      <p>Most of the guide will cover any weather hardware, but the exact data
        types are specific to the Davis Vantage series. Unless you are using an
        unusual type you are unlikely to run into trouble. </p>
      <p class="warning"><strong>Warning!</strong><br />
        <span class="code">weewx</span> is still an experimental system and, as
        such, its internal design is subject to change. Be prepared to do
        updates to any code or customization you do! </p>
      <h2>Overview of the weewx architecture</h2>
      <p>At a high-level, <span class="code">weewx</span> consists of an engine
        class called <span class="code">StdEngine</span>. It is responsible for
        loading "<em>services</em>", then arranging for them to be called when
        key events occur, such as the arrival of LOOP data. The default install
        of <span class="code">weewx</span> includes the following services: </p>

              can be added easily by the user.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>It is easy to extend old services or to add new ones. The source
        distribution includes an example new service called "<span class="code">MyAlarm</span>,"
        which sends an email when an arbitrary expression evaluates <span class="code">True</span>.
        These advanced topics are covered later in the section <em><a href="#service_engine">Customizing
            the weewx service engine</a></em>. </p>
      <h2>The standard reporting service, <span class="code">StdReport</span></h2>
      <p>For the moment, let us focus on the last service, <span class="code">weewx.wxengine.StdReport</span>,
        the standard service for creating reports. This will be what most users
        will want to customize even if it means changing just a few options. </p>
      <h3>Reports</h3>
      <p>The Standard Report Service runs zero or more <em>Reports.</em> The
        specific reports which get run are set in the configuration file <span
          class="code">weewx.conf</span>, in section <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The default distribution of <span class="code">weewx</span> includes
        three reports: </p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 80%" summary="Standard reports included in weewx">

            <td>Generates day, week, month and year "to-date" summaries in HTML,

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">FTP</td>
            <td>Arranges to upload everything in the <span class="symcode">$HTML_ROOT</span>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">RSYNC</td>
            <td>Like FTP, but uses rsync for transferring files to a remote
              webserver.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note that the FTP and RSYNC "reports" are a funny kind of report in
        that it they do not actually generate anything. Instead, they use the
        reporting service engine to arrange for things to be transferred to a
        remote server. </p>
      <h3>Skins</h3>
      <p>Each report has a <em>Skin</em> associated with it. For most reports,
        the relationship with the skin is an obvious one: it contains the
        templates, any auxiliary files such as background GIFs or CSS style
        sheets, and a <em>skin configuration file</em>, <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
        If you will, the skin controls the <em>look and feel </em>of the
        report. Note that more than one report can use the same skin. For
        example, you might want to run a report that uses US Customary units,
        then run another report against the same skin, but using metric units
        and put the results in a different place. All this is possible by either
        overriding configuration options in the <span class="code">weewx</span>
        configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> or the skin
        configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. </p>
      <p>Like all reports, the FTP and RSYNC "Reports" also use a skin, and
        include a skin configuration file, although they are quite minimal. </p>
      <p>Skins live in their own subdirectory located in <span class="symcode">$SKIN_ROOT</span>.
      </p>
      <h3>Generators</h3>
      <p>To create their output, skins rely on one or more <em>Generators, </em>code
        that actually create useful things such as HTML files or plot images.
        Generators can also copy files around or FTP/rsync them to remote
        locations. The default install of <span class="code">weewx </span>includes
        the following generators: </p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 80%" summary="Generators included in weewx">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Generator</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Function</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</td>
            <td>Generates files from templates, using the Cheetah template engine. Used to generate HTML and text
              files.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">weewx.imagegenerator.ImageGenerator</td>
            <td>Generates graph plots.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">weewx.reportengine.FtpGenerator</td>
            <td>Uploads data to a remote server using FTP.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">weewx.reportengine.RsyncGenerator</td>
            <td>Uploads data to a remote server using rsync.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</td>
            <td>Copies files locally.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note that the three generators <span class="code">FtpGenerator</span>,
        <span class="code">RsyncGenerator</span>, and <span class="code">CopyGenerator</span>
        do not actually generate anything having to do with the presentation
        layer. Instead, they just move files around. </p>
      <p>Which generators are to be run for a given skin is specified in the
        skin's configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, in
        section <a href="#Generators_section"><span class="code">[Generators]</span></a>.</p>
      <h2>Databases</h2>
      <p>There are two databases used by <span class="code">weewx</span>, which
        can be implemented either by using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLITE3</a>,
        an open-source, lightweight SQL database, or <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">
          MySQL</a>, an open-source, full-featured database server, or some
        combination of the two of them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>archive database</em>, given symbolic name '<span class="code">archive_database</span>'.
          It is a big flat table, one record for each archive interval, keyed by
          <span class="code">dateTime</span>, the time at the end of the archive
          interval. </li>
        <li>The <em>statistical database</em>, given symbolic name '<span class="code">stats_database</span>'.
          It consists of a separate table for each observation type (that is,
          one for '<span class="code">outTemp</span>', one for '<span class="code">barometer</span>',
          <em>etc.</em>), each containing one record per day, keyed by the start
          time of the day. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>How these abstract databases are bound to the real database is covered
        in the <a href="usersguide.htm">Weewx User's Guide</a>, in section '<a
          href="usersguide.htm#StdArchive">[StdArchive]</a>'.</p>
      <p>The important thing to remember is that the archive database contains a
        record for every archive interval and, as such, represents the <em>current
          conditions</em> at the time of the observation. By contrast, the
        statistical database represents the <em>aggregation of conditions over
          a day</em>. That is, it contains the daily minimum, maximum, and the
        time of the minimum and maximum, for each observation type. As you can
        imagine, the statistical database is much smaller because it represents
        only a summary of the data. </p>
      <p>The archive database is used for both generating plot data and in
        template generation (where it appears as tag <span class="code">$current</span>).
        The statistical database is used only in template generation (where it
        appears as tags <span class="code">$day</span>, <span class="code">$week</span>,
        <span class="code">$month</span>, <span class="code">$year</span>, and
        <span class="code">$rainyear</span>, depending on the aggregation time
        period). </p>
      <a name="reports"></a>
      <h1>Opportunities for customizing reports</h1>
      <p>This section discusses the two general strategies for customizing
        reports: by changing options in one or more configuration file, or by
        changing the template files. The former is generally easier, but
        occasionally the latter is necessary. </p>
      <h2>Changing options</h2>
      <p>Changing an option means either modifying the main configuration file <span
          class="code">weewx.conf</span>, or the skin configuration file for the
        standard skin that comes with the distribution (nominally, file <span class="symcode">$SKIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/Standard/skin.conf</span>). </p>
      <h3>Changing options in <span class="code">skin.conf</span></h3>
      <p>With this approach, the user edits the skin configuration file for the
        standard skin that comes with <span class="code">weewx</span>, located
        in <span class="symcode">$SKIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/Standard/skin.conf</span>,
        using a text editor. For example, suppose you wish to use metric units
        in the presentation layer, instead of the default US Customary Units.
        The section that controls units is <span class="code">[Units][[Groups]]</span>.
        It looks like this: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Groups]]
        group_altitude    = foot
        group_degree_day  = degree_F_day 
        group_direction   = degree_compass
        group_moisture    = centibar
        group_percent     = percent
        group_pressure    = inHg
        group_radiation   = watt_per_meter_squared
        group_rain        = inch
        group_rainrate    = inch_per_hour
        group_speed       = mile_per_second
        group_speed2      = mile_per_second2
        group_temperature = degree_F
        group_uv          = uv_index 
        group_volt        = volt</pre>
      <p>To use metric units, you would edit this section to read: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Groups]]
<span class="highlight">        group_altitude    = meter</span>
<span class="highlight">        group_degree_day  = degree_C_day </span>
        group_direction   = degree_compass
        group_moisture    = centibar
        group_percent     = percent
<span class="highlight">        group_pressure    = mbar</span>
        group_radiation   = watt_per_meter_squared
<span class="highlight">        group_rain        = mm</span>
<span class="highlight">        group_rainrate    = mm_per_hour</span>
<span class="highlight">        group_speed       = meter_per_second</span>
<span class="highlight">        group_speed2      = meter_per_second2</span>
<span class="highlight">        group_temperature = degree_C</span>
        group_uv          = uv_index 
        group_volt        = volt</pre>
      <p>The options that were changed have been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>.
        Details of the various unit options are given in <em><a href="#units">Appendix
            B: Units</a></em>. </p>
      <p>Other options are available, such as changing the text label for
        various observation types. For example, suppose your weather console is
        actually located in a barn, not indoors, and you want the plot for the
        temperature at the console to be labeled "Barn Temperature," rather than
        the default "Inside Temperature." This can be done by changing the "<span
          class="code">inTemp</span>" option located in section <span class="code">[Labels][[Generic]]</span>
        from the default </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Generic]]
        inTemp  = Inside Temperature
        outTemp = Outside Temperature
        ...</pre>
      <p>to: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Generic]]
<span class="highlight">        inTemp  = Barn Temperature</span>
        outTemp = Outside Temperature
        ...</pre>
      <h3>Overriding options in <span class="code">skin.conf</span> from <span
          class="code">weewx.conf</span></h3>
      <p>This approach is very similar, except that instead of changing the skin
        configuration file directly, you override its options by editing the
        main configuration file, <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. The
        advantage of this approach is that you can use the same skin to produce
        several different output, each with separate options. </p>
      <p>Revisiting our example, suppose you want two reports, one in US
        Customary, the other in Metric. The former will go in the directory <span
          class="symcode"> $HTML_ROOT</span>, the latter in a subdirectory, <span
          class="symcode"> $HTML_ROOT</span><span class="code">/metric</span>.
        If you just simply modify <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, you can
        get one, but not both at the same time. Alternatively, you could create
        a whole new skin by copying all the files to a new skin subdirectory
        then editing the new <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. The trouble
        with this approach is that you would then have <em>two</em> skins you
        would have to maintain. If you change something, you have to remember to
        change it in both places. </p>
      <p>But, there's a better approach: reuse the same skin, but override some
        of its options. Here is what your <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>
        section in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> would look like: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[StdReport]
    #
    # This section specifies what reports, using which skins, are to be generated.
    #

    # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
    SKIN_ROOT = skins

    # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
    HTML_ROOT = public_html

    # This report will use US Customary Units
    [[USReport]]
        # It is based on the Standard skin
        skin = Standard

    # This report will use metric units:
    [[MetricReport]]
        # It is also based on the Standard skin:
        skin = Standard 
        # However, override where the results will go and put them in a subdirectory:
        HTML_ROOT = public_html/metric
    
        # And override the options that were not in metric units
        [[[Units]]]
            [[[[Groups]]]]
                group_altitude    = meter
                group_pressure    = mbar
                group_rain        = mm
                group_rainrate    = mm_per_hour
                group_speed       = meter_per_second
                group_speed2      = meter_per_second2
                group_temperature = degree_C

    [[FTP]]
    ...
    ... (as before) </pre>
      <p>We have done two things different from the stock reports. First (1), we
        have renamed the first report from <span class="code">StandardReport </span>to
        <span class="code">USReport </span>for clarity; and (2) we have
        introduced a new report <span class="code">MetricReport</span>, just
        like the first, except it puts its results in a different spot and uses
        different units. Both use the same skin, the <span class="code">Standard
          </span>skin. </p>
      <a name="templates"></a>
      <h2>Customizing templates</h2>
      <p>If you cannot achieve the results you need by changing a configuration
        option, you may have to modify the templates that come with <span class="code">weewx</span>,
        or write your own. </p>
      <p>Template modifications are preserved across upgrades (indeed,
        everything in the <span class="code">./skins</span> subdirectory is
        preserved), so you don't have to worry about losing changes.</p>
      <p>Template generation is done using the <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>
        templating engine. This is a very powerful engine, which essentially
        lets you have the full semantics of Python available in your templates.
        As this would make the templates incomprehensible to anyone but a Python
        programmer, <span class="code">weewx</span> adopts a very small subset
        of its power. </p>
      <p>The key construct is a 'dot' code, specifying what value you want. For
        example: </p>
      <pre class="tty">$month.outTemp.max
$month.outTemp.maxtime
$current.outTemp</pre>
      <p>would code the max outside temperature for the month, the time it
        occurred, and the current outside temperature, respectively. So, an HTML
        file that looks like </p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Current conditions&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Current temperature = $current.outTemp&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max for the month is $month.outTemp.max, which occurred at $month.outTemp.maxtime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
      <p>would be all you need for a very simple HTML page that would display
        the text (assuming that the unit group for temperature is <span class="code">degree_F</span>):
        </p>
      <p class="example_output">Current temperature = 51.0°F <br />
        Max for the month is 68.8°F, which occurred at 07-Oct-2009 15:15 </p>
      <p>The format that was used to format the temperature (<span class="code">51.0</span>)
        is specified in section <span class="code"><a href="#Units_StringFormats">[Units][[StringFormat]]</a></span>.
        The unit label <span class="code">°F</span> is from section <span class="code"><a
            href="#Units_Labels">[Units][[Labels]]</a></span>, while the time
        format is from <span class="code"><a href="#Units_TimeFormats">[Units][[TimeFormats]]</a></span>.
      </p>
      <h3>The dot code</h3>
      <p>As we saw above, the dot codes can be very simple: </p>
      <pre class="tty">## Output max outside temperature using an appropriate format and label:
$month.outTemp.max</pre>
      <p>Most of the time, the dot code will "do the right thing" and is all you
        will need. However, <span class="code">weewx</span> offers extensive
        customization of the generate output for specialized applications such
        as XML RSS feeds, or ridgidly formatted reports (such as the NOAA
        reports). This section specifies the various options available. </p>
      <p>There are two different versions of the dot code, depending on whether
        the data is "current", or an aggregation over time. However, both
        versions are very similar </p>
      <h4>Time period <span class="code">$current</span></h4>
      <p>Time period <span class="code">$current</span> represents a <em>current
          observation</em>. An example would be the current barometric pressure:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">$current.barometer</pre>
      <p>The dot code for a current observation looks like: </p>
      <pre class="tty"><em>$current.obstype[.optional_unit_conversion][.optional_formatting]</em></pre>
      <p>Where: </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code"><em>obstype</em></span> is an
        observation type, such as <span class="code">barometer</span>. See <em>
          <a href="#archive_types">Appendix A, Archive Types</a></em> for a
        table of observation types valid for time period <span class="code">current.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code">optional_unit_conversion</span> is an
        optional unit conversion tag. If provided, the results will be converted
        into the specified units, otherwise the default units specified in the
        skin configuration file (in section <span class="code">[Units][[Groups]]</span>)
        will be used. See the section <em><a href="#unit_conversion_options">Unit
            Conversion Options</a></em> below. </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code"><em>optional_formatting</em></span>
        is an optional formatting tag that controls how the value will appear.
        See the section <em><a href="#formatting_options">Formatting Options</a></em>

      <h4>Aggregation periods <span class="code">$day</span>, <span class="code">$week</span>,
        <span class="code">$month</span>, <span class="code">$year</span>, <span
          class="code">$rainyear</span> </h4>
      <p>The other time periods represent an <em>aggregation over time</em>. In
        addition to the time period over which the aggregation will occur, they
        also require an <em>aggregation type</em>. An example would be the
        week's total precipitation (where the aggregation type is <span class="code"><em>sum</em></span>):
        </p>
      <pre class="tty">$week.rain.sum</pre>
      <p>The dot code for an aggregation over time looks like: </p>
      <pre class="tty"><em>$period.statstype.aggregation[.optional_unit_conversion][.optional_formatting]</em></pre>
      <p>Where: </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code"><em>period</em></span> is the time
        period over which the aggregation is to be done. Possible choices are <span
          class="code">day</span>, <span class="code">week</span>, <span class="code">month</span>,
        <span class="code">year</span>, <span class="code">rainyear</span>. </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code"><em>statstype</em></span> is a
        statistical type. See <em><a href="#statistical_types">Appendix C,
            Statistical Types</a></em>, for a table of statistical types. </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code"><em>aggregation</em></span> is an
        aggregation type. This is something like '<span class="code">min</span>',
        '<span class="code">sum</span>', '<span class="code">mintime</span>'. If
        you ask for <span class="code">$month.outTemp.avg</span> you are asking
        for the <em>average</em> outside temperature for the month. The table <em>
          <a href="#statistical_types">Appendix C: Statistical Types</a></em>
        shows what aggregation types are available for which types. </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code">optional_unit_conversion</span> is an

        into the specified units, otherwise the default units specified in the
        skin configuration file (in section <span class="code">[Units][[Groups]]</span>)
        will be used. See the section <em><a href="#unit_conversion_options">Unit
            Conversion Options</a></em> below. </p>
      <p class="indent"><span class="code"><em>optional_formatting</em></span>
        is an optional formatting tag that controls how the value will appear.
        See the section <em><a href="#formatting_options">Formatting Options</a></em>
        below. </p>
      <a name="unit_conversion_options"></a>
      <h4>Unit conversion options</h4>
      <p>The tag <span class="code"><em>optional_unit_conversion</em></span>
        can be used with either current observations or aggregations. If
        supplied, the results will be converted to the specified units. For
        example, if you have set <span class="code">group_pressure</span> to
        inches of mercury (<span class="code">inHg</span>), then the tag </p>
      <pre class="tty">Today's average pressure=$day.barometer.avg </pre>
      <p>would normally give a result such as </p>
      <p class="example_output">Today's average pressure=30.05 inHg </p>
      <p>However, if you add "<span class="code">mbar</span>" to the end, </p>
      <pre class="tty">$day.barometer.avg.mbar </pre>
      <p>then the results will be in millibars: </p>
      <p class="example_output">Today's average pressure=1017.5 mbar </p>
      <h5>Wind ordinals</h5>
      <p>Using this method, you can output compass ordinals for wind direction.
        For example, the template</p>
      <pre class="tty">Current wind direction is $current.windDir ($current.windDir.ordinal_compass)</pre>
      <p>would result in:</p>
      <p class="example_output">Current wind direction is 138° (SW)</p>
      <p>The ordinal abbreviations that are used are set by option <span class="code">directions</span>
        in the skin configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.</p>
      <h5>Illegal conversions</h5>
      <p>If an inappropriate conversion is asked for, <em>e.g.</em>, </p>
      <pre class="tty">Today's average pressure=$day.barometer.degree_C </pre>
      <p>then the offending tag will be put in the output: </p>
      <p class="example_output">Today's average pressure=$day.barometer.degree_C
      </p>

      <p>Note: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags that take an argument (such as <span class="code">.string(NONE_string)</span>)
          do not require parenthesis if the argument is omitted.Thus, you can
          specify either <span class="code">$month.outTemp.string()</span> or <span
            class="code">$month.outTemp.string</span>, if you want the default
          value of <span class="code">NONE_string</span>. They produce the same
          results. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Type <span class="code">dateTime</span></h3>
      <p>While not an observation type, in many ways the time of an observation,
        <span class="code">dateTime</span>, can be treated as one. A tag such as
        <span class="code">$current.dateTime</span> represents the <em>current
          time</em> (more properly, the time as of the end of the last archive
        interval). Similarly, a tag such as <span class="code">$month.dateTime</span>
        represents the start time of the month. Like true observation types,
        explicit formats can be specified, except that they require a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior">
          strftime() <em>time format</em></a>, rather than a <em>string
          format:</em> </p>
      <pre class="tty">$month.dateTime.format("%B %Y)</pre>
      <p>produces </p>
      <pre class="tty">January 2010</pre>
      <p>The returned string value will always be in <em>local time</em>. </p>
      <p>The raw value of <span class="code">dateTime</span> is Unix Epoch Time
        (number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970, <em>i.e.</em>, a
        large number), which you must convert yourself to local time. It is
        guaranteed to never be <span class="code">None</span>, so you don't
        worry have to worry about handling a <span class="code">None</span>
        value. </p>
      <h3>Tag <span class="code">$trend</span></h3>
      <p>The tag <span class="code">$trend</span> is available for time trends,
        such as barometer trends. Here are some examples:</p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 40%" summary="Examples of using unit formats">

            <td class="code">3 hrs</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note that the time delta over which the trend is calculated is also
        available. This time delta is set by an option in the skin configuration
        file, <span class="code"><a href="#Trend">time_delta</a></span>.</p>
      <p>As a summary, the template expression</p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;p&gt;The barometer trend over $trend.time_delta.hour is $trend.barometer.format("%+.2f").&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
      <p>would result in</p>
      <p class="example_output">The barometer trend over 3 hrs is +.02 inHg.</p>
      <h3>Tag <span class="code">$unit</span></h3>
      <p>The unit type, label, and string formats are also available, allowing
        you to do highly customized labels: </p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 40%" summary="Examples of using unit formats">
        <tbody>
          <tr>

            <td class="code">%.1f</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>As a summary, the tag </p>
      <pre class="tty">$day.outTemp.max.formatted$unit.label.outTemp</pre>
      <p>would result in </p>
      <pre class="tty">21.2°C</pre>
      <p>(assuming metric values have been specified for <span class="code">group_temperature</span>),
        essentially reproducing the results of the simpler tag <span class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span>.
      </p>
      <h3>Iteration</h3>
      <p>For dot codes using an aggregation (<em>e.g.</em>, <span class="code">$day</span>,
        <span class="code">$week</span>, <span class="code">$month</span>, <span
          class="code">$year</span>, <span class="code">$rainyear</span>, then
        the aggregation period can be iterated over by day or month. These are
        the only two iteration periods available as of this version. </p>
      <p>This example uses a Cheetah '<span class="code">for</span>' loop to
        iterate over all months in a year, printing out each month's min and max
        temperature (the iteration loop is highlighted): </p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Year stats by month&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Min, max temperatures by month:&lt;/p&gt;
<span class="highlight">        #for $month in $year.months</span>
        &lt;p&gt;$month.dateTime.format("%B"): Min, max temperatures: $month.outTemp.min $month.outTemp.max&lt;/p&gt;
<span class="highlight">        #end for </span>
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
      <p>Produces results: </p>
      <pre class="tty">Min, max temperatures by month:
January: Min, max temperatures: 30.1°F 51.5°F
February: Min, max temperatures: 24.4°F 58.6°F

        and <span class="code">NOAA/NOAA-YYYY-MM.txt.tmpl</span> for examples
        using iteration, as well as explicit formatting. </p>
      <h3>Almanac</h3>
      <p>If module <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem">pyephem</a> has been
        installed, then <span class="code">weewx</span> can generate extensive
        almanac information for the Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and other
        heavenly bodies, including their rise, transit and set times, as well as
        their azimuth and altitude. Other information is also available. </p>
      <p>Here is a small sampling: </p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Almanac data&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Current time is $current.dateTime&lt;p&gt;
        #if $almanac.hasExtras
        &lt;p&gt;Sunrise, transit, sunset: $almanac.sun.rise $almanac.sun.transit $almanac.sun.set&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moonrise, transit, moonset: $almanac.moon.rise $almanac.moon.transit $almanac.moon.set&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mars rise, transit, set: $almanac.mars.rise $almanac.mars.transit $almanac.mars.set&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Azimuth, altitude of mars: $almanac.mars.az $almanac.mars.alt&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next new, full moon: $almanac.next_new_moon $almanac.next_full_moon&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next summer, winter solstice: $almanac.next_summer_solstice $almanac.next_winter_solstice&lt;/p&gt;
        #else
        &lt;p&gt;Sunrise, sunset: $almanac.sunrise $almanac.sunset&lt;/p&gt;
        #end if
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
      <p>If your installation has pyephem installed this would result in: </p>
      <pre class="tty">Current time is 29-Mar-2011 09:20

Next summer, winter solstice: 21-Jun-2011 10:16 21-Dec-2011 21:29</pre>
      <p>Otherwise, a fallback position is used, resulting in </p>
      <pre class="tty">Current time is 29-Mar-2011 09:20
Sunrise, sunset: 06:51 19:30</pre>
      <p>As shown in the example, you can test whether this extended almanac
        information is available with the value <span class="code">$almanac.hasExtras</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The almanac information falls in two categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calendar events</li>
        <li>Heavenly bodies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will cover each of these separately.</p>
      <h4>Calendar events</h4>
      <p>"Calendar events" do not require a heavenly body. They cover things
        such as "<span class="code">next_solstice</span>", or "<span class="code">next_first_quarter_moon</span>".
        The syntax here is </p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.next_solstice</pre>
      <p>or </p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.next_first_quarter_moon</pre>
      <p>Here is a table of the information that falls into this category:</p>
      <table align="center" class="code" style="width: 60%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_equinox</td>
            <td>next_equinox</td>
            <td>previous_solstice</td>
            <td>next_solstice</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_autumnal_equinox</td>
            <td>next_autumnal_equinox</td>
            <td>previous_vernal_equinox</td>
            <td>next_vernal_equinox</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_winter_solstice</td>
            <td>next_winter_solstice</td>
            <td>previous_summer_solstice</td>
            <td>next_summer_solstice</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_new_moon</td>
            <td>next_new_moon</td>
            <td>previous_first_quarter_moon</td>
            <td>next_first_quarter_moon</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_full_moon</td>
            <td>next_full_moon</td>
            <td>previous_last_quarter_moon</td>
            <td>next_last_quarter_moon</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h4>Heavenly bodies</h4>
      <p>The second category does require a heavenly body. This covers queries
        such as, "When does Jupiter rise?" or, "When does the sun transit?"
        Examples are</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.jupiter.rise</pre>
      <p>or</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.sun.transit</pre>
      <p>To accurately calculate these times, <span class="code">weewx</span>
        automatically uses the present temperature and pressure to calculate
        refraction effects. However, you can override these values, which will
        be necessary if you wish to match the almanac times published by the
        Naval Observatory <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/rise-set.html">as
          explained in the pyephem documentation</a>. For example, to match the
        sunrise time as published by the Observatory, instead of</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.sun.rise</pre>
      <p>use</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=0, horizon=-34.0/60.0).sun.rise</pre>
      <p>By setting pressure to zero we are bypassing the refraction
        calculations and manually setting the horizon to be 34 arcminutes lower
        than the normal horizon. This is what the Navy uses.</p>
      <p>If you wish to calculate the start of civil twilight, you can set the
        horizon to -6 degrees, and also tell <span class="code">weewx</span> to
        use the center of the sun (instead of the upper limb, which it normally
        uses) to do the calcuation:</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=0, horizon=-6).sun(use_center=1).rise</pre>
      <p>The general syntax is:</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=<em>pressure</em>, horizon=<em>horizon</em>,
         temperature=<em>temperature_C</em>).<em>heavenly_body</em>(use_center=[01]).<em>attribute</em></pre>
      <p>As you can see, in addition to the horizon angle, you can also override
        atmospheric pressure and temperature (degrees Celsius).</p>
      <p>PyEphem offers an extensive list of objects that can be used for the <span
          class="code"><em>heavenly_body</em></span> tag. All the planets and
        many stars are in the list.</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">attribute</span> tag can be one of </p>

      <a name="defining_new_tags"></a>
      <h2>Defining new tags</h2>
      In the section on <em><a href="#templates">Customizing templates</a></em>,
      we have seen how you can change a template and make use of the various
      tags available such as <span class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span> for the
      maximum outside temperature for the day. But, what if you want to
      introduce some new data for which no tag is available?
      <p>If you wish to introduce a static tag, that is, one that will not
        change with time (such as a Google analytics Tracker ID, or your name),
        then this is very easy: simply put it in section <span class="code"><a
            href="#Extras">[Extras]</a></span> in the skin configuration file.
        More information on how to do this can be found there. </p>
      <p>But, what if you wish to introduce a more dynamic tag, one that
        requires some calculation, or perhaps uses the database? Simply putting it
        in the <span class="code">[Extras]</span> section won't do, because
        then it cannot change. </p>
      <p>The answer is to write a <em>search list extension</em>.</p>
      <h3>Search list</h3>
      <p> The Cheetah template engine (which <span class="code">weewx</span> uses) finds tags by 
		scanning a <em>search
          list</em>,
          a Python list of objects. For example, for a tag <span class="code">$foo</span>, the
          engine will scan down the list, trying each object <span class="code">obj</span> in turn. First
          it tries using <span class="code">foo</span> as an attribute, that is, 
		<span class="code">obj.foo</span>. If that raises an
          exception <span class="code">AttributeError</span>, then it will try 
		<span class="code">foo</span> as a key, that is
          <span class="code">obj[key]</span>. If that raises a 
		<span class="code">KeyError</span>, then it moves on to the next item
          in the list. The first match that does not raise an exception is
          returned. If no match is found, it raises a <span class="code">NameMapper.NotFound</span>
          exception.</p>
		<h3>
        Extending the list</h3>
      <p>Weewx comes with a number of objects already in the search list, but you can 
	  extend it. To do so, you should have some familiarity with Python, in
      particular, how to write new classes and member functions for them. </p>
      <p>Let's look at an example. The regular version of <span class="code">weewx</span>
        offers statistical summaries by day, week, month, and year. Suppose we
        would like to add two more: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All-time statistics. This would allow us to display statistics such
          as the all-time high or low temperature seen at your station;</li>
        <li>Seven days statistics. While <span class="code">weewx</span> offers
          the tag <span class="code">$week</span>, this is statistics <em>since
            Sunday at midnight</em>. We would like to have statistics for a full
          week, that is since midnight seven days ago.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This example is included in the distribution as <span class="symcode">
          $BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/examples/xsearch.py</span>: </p>

        # Now get a TimeSpanStats object for the last seven days. This one we
        # will have to calculate. First, calculate the time at midnight, seven
        # days ago. The variable week_dt will be an instance of datetime.date.
        week_dt = datetime.date.fromtimestamp(valid_timespan.stop) - datetime.timedelta(weeks=1)    #5
        # Now convert it to unix epoch time:
        week_ts = time.mktime(week_dt.timetuple())                  # 6
        # Now form a TimeSpanStats object, using the time span we just calculated:
        seven_day_stats = TimeSpanStats(TimeSpan(week_ts, valid_timespan.stop),
                                        statsdb,
                                        formatter=self.generator.formatter,
                                        converter=self.generator.converter)   #7

        # Now create a small dictionary with keys 'alltime' and 'seven_day':
        search_list_extension = {'alltime'   : all_stats,
                                 'seven_day' : seven_day_stats}               # 8
        
        return search_list_extension&nbsp;</pre>
      <p>Going through the example, line by line: </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Create a
          new class called <span class="code">MyXSearch</span>, which will 
		  inherit from class <span class="code">SearchList</span>. All search 
		  list extensions inherit from this class.</li>
		  <li>Create an initializer for our new class. In this case, the 
		  initializer does nothing except pass its only parameter,
		  <span class="code">generator</span>, a reference to the calling 
		  generator, to its superclass, <span class="code">SearchList</span>. 
		  The superclass will store it in <span class="code">self</span>.</li>
        <li>Override member function <span class="code">get_extension()</span>.
          This function will be called when the generator is ready to accept 
		your new search list extension. The parameters that will be passed in are:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="code">self</span> Python's way of indicating the
              instance we are working with;</li>
            <li><span class="code">valid_timespan</span> An instance of the
              utility class <span class="code">TimeSpan</span>. This will
              contain the valid start and ending times used by the template. 
			Normally, this is all valid times; </li>
            <li><span class="code">archivedb</span> An instance of <span class="code">weewx.archive.Archive</span>,
              holding the archive database;</li>
            <li><span class="code">statsdb</span> An instance of <span class="code">weewx.stats.StatsDb</span>, 
			holding the statistical database.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The class <span class="code">TimeSpanStats</span> represents a
          statistical calculation over a time period. In our case, we will set
          it up to represent the statistics over all possible times. The class
          takes 4 parameters.
          <ul>
            <li>The first is the timespan over which the calculation is to be
              done. Here, we have a lucky coincidence: the variable <span class="code">valid_timespan</span>
              already holds a <span class="code">TimeSpan</span> object
              representing the domain of all valid timespans, so we simply pass it
              in.</li>
            <li>The second is the statistical database the calculation is to be
              run against. We simply pass in <span class="code">statsdb</span>.</li>
            <li>The third should be an instance of class <span class="code">weewx.units.Formatter</span>, 
			which contains information about how the results should be 
			formatted. We just pass in the formatter set up by the generator,
              <span class="code">self.generator.formatter</span>.</li>
            <li>The fourth should be an instance of <span class="code">weewx.units.Converter</span>,
              which contains information about the target units (<em>e.g.</em>,
              "<span class="code">degree_C</span>") that are to be used. Again, 
			we just pass in the instance set up by the generator, <span class="code">self.generator.converter</span>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>That one was relatively easy because we already had an instance of <span
          class="code">TimeSpan</span>, <span class="code">valid_timespan</span>,
        that represented the time over which we wanted to do the calculations.
        Setting up an instance that will work for the last seven days is a bit
        trickier. Continuing our example...</p>
        <ol start="5">
        <li>The object <span class="code">valid_timespan</span> holds the
          domain of all valid times, but in order to calculate statistics for 
		the last seven days, we need not the earliest valid time, but the time
          at midnight seven days ago. So, we do a little Python date arithmetic
          to calculate this. The object <span class="code">week_dt</span> will
          be an instance of <span class="code">datetime.date</span>.</li>
        <li>We convert it to unix epoch time.</li>
        <li>Now we are ready to initialize an appropriate <span class="code">TimeSpanStats</span>
          object. It's the same as in step #4, except we use our new timespan
          object.</li>
        <li>Create a small dictionary with two keys, '<span class="code">alltime</span>', and
          '<span class="code">seven_day</span>' and return it. </li>
      </ol>
        <p>The last step is to tell the template engine where to find our 
		extension. You do that by going into the skin configuration file,
		<span class="code">skin.conf</span>, and editing the option
		<span class="code">search_list</span>, adding our new extension 
		somewhere in the list. When you're done, it will look something like 
		this:</p>
		<pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]

    #
    # This section is used by the generator CheetahGenerator, and specifies which
    # files are to be generated from which template.
    #

    encoding = html_entities    # Possible encodings are 'html_entities', 'utf8', or 'strict_ascii'
    
    search_list = <span class="highlight">examples.xsearch.MyXSearch, </span>weewx.cheetahgenerator.Almanac, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Station, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Stats, weewx.cheetahgenerator.UnitInfo, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Extras, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Current
  
    ... (as before)</pre>
		<p>Here, the addition has been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>. 
		Note that it is in the section <span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span>. 
		This section was called <span class="code">[FileGenerator]</span> in 
		earlier versions of <span class="code">weewx</span>, a name which will 
		still work. Incidentally, you can see the search list extensions that 
		come with <span class="code">weewx</span>, and the familiar tags they provide.</p>
		<p>Now, if the Cheetah engine encounters the tag <span class="code">
		$alltime</span>, it will scan the search list, looking for an attribute 
		or key that matches <span class="code">alltime</span>. When it gets to 
		the little dictionary we provided, it will find a matching key, allowing 
		it to retrieve
          the appropriate <span class="code">TimeSpanStats</span> object.</p>
      <p>With this approach, you can now include "all time" or "seven day"
        statistics in your HTML templates: </p>
      <pre class="tty">...
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Maximum temperature to date: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$alltime.outTemp.max&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Minimum temperature to date: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$alltime.outTemp.min
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Rain over the last seven days: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$seven_day.rain.sum
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    ... (more table entries)</pre>
      <p>NB: If you create a custom generator some place other than where <span
          class="code">weewxd</span> resides, you may have to specify its
        location in the environment variable <span class="code">PYTHONPATH</span>:
      </p>
        <pre class="tty">export PYTHONPATH=/home/me/secret_location</pre>
		<h2>Upgrades and user extensions</h2>
      <p>In the examples above, we subclassed <span class="code">weewx</span>
        classes to add functionality. Where should you put your new code? If you
        simply modify the examples in place, then your changes will get
        overwritten the next time you do an upgrade, forcing you to cut and
        paste any changes you have made. </p>
      <p>A better idea is to copy over the examples to the subdirectory <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/user</span>, then modify them there. This subdirectory
        is preserved through upgrades, so you won't have to redo any changes you
        might have made. </p>
      <a name="standard_skin"></a>
      <h1>Reference: The Standard skin configuration file</h1>
      <p>This section is a reference to the options appearing in the Standard
        skin configuration file, found in <span class="symcode">$SKIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/Standard/skin.conf</span>. </p>
      <p>It is worth noting that, like the main configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>,
        UTF-8 is used throughout. The most important options are up near the top
        of the file. The truly important ones, the ones you are likely to have
        to customize for your station, are <span class="config_important"><strong>highlighted</strong></span>.
      </p>
      <a name="Extras"></a>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Extras]</h2>
      <p>This section is available to you to add any static tags that you might
        want to be available in the templates. As an example, the stock <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
        file includes two options: <span class="code">radar_url</span>, which
        is available as tag <span class="code">$Extras.radar_url</span>, and <span
          class="code">googleAnalyticsId</span>, available as tag <span class="code">$Extras.googleAnalyticsId</span>.
        If you take a look at the template <span class="code">index.html.tmpl</span>
        you will see examples of testing for these tags (search the file for the
        string <span class="code">radar_url</span> or <span class="code">googleAnalyticsId</span>
        to find them). </p>
      <p class="config_option">radar_url </p>
      <p>If set, the NOAA radar image will be displayed. If commented out, no
        image will be displayed. </p>
      <p class="config_option">googleAnalyticsId </p>
      <p>If you have a <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google
          Analytics ID</a>, you can set it here. The Google Analytics Javascript
        code will then be included, enabling analytics of your website usage. If
        commented out, the code will not be included. </p>
      <h4>Extending <span class="code">[Extras]</span></h4>
      <p>Other tags can be added in a similar manner, including subsections. For
        example, say you have added a video camera and you would like to add a
        still image with a hyperlink to a page with the video. You want all of
        these options to be neatly contained in a subsection. </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Extras]
    [[video]]
        still = video_capture.jpg
        hyperlink = <a href="http://www.eatatjoes.com/video.html">http://www.eatatjoes.com/video.html</a></pre>
      <p>Then in your template you could refer to these as: </p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;a href="$Extras.video.hyperlink"&gt;
    &lt;img src="$Extras.video.still" alt="Video capture"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Units]</h2>
      <p>This section deals with Units and their formatting. </p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Groups]]</h3>
      <p>This subsection lists all the <em>Unit Groups</em> and specifies which
        unit system is to be used for each one of them. </p>
      <p>As there are many different observational measurement types (such as '<span
          class="code">outTemp</span>', '<span class="code">barometer</span>',
        etc.) used in <span class="code">weewx</span> (more than 50 at last
        count), it would be tedious, not to say possibly inconsistent, to
        specify a different measurement system for each one of them. At the
        other extreme, requiring all of them to be "U.S. Customary" or "Metric"
        seems overly restrictive. <span class="code">Weewx</span> has taken a
        middle route and divided all the different observation types into 12
        different "<em>unit groups</em>." A unit group is something like "<span
          class="code">group_temperature</span>." It represents the measurement
        system to be used by all observation types that are measured in
        temperature, such as inside temperature (type '<span class="code">inTemp</span>'),
        outside temperature ('<span class="code">outTemp</span>'), dewpoint ('<span
          class="code">dewpoint</span>'), wind chill ('<span class="code">windchill</span>'),
        and so on. If you decide that you want unit group <span class="code">group_temperature</span>
        to be measured in "<span class="code">degree_C</span>" then you are
        saying <em>all</em> members of its group will be reported in degrees
        Celsius. </p>
      <p>Note that the unit system is always specified in the singular. That is,
        specify "<span class="code">degree_C</span>" or "<span class="code">foot</span>",
        not "<span class="code">degrees_C</span>" or "<span class="code">feet</span>".
        See the Appendix <em> <a href="#units">Units</a></em> for more
        information, including a concise summary of the groups, their members,
        and which options can be used for each group. </p>
      <p class="config_important"><a class="config_option" name="group_altitude">group_altitude</a>
      </p>
      <p>Which measurement unit to be used for altitude. Possible options are '<span
          class="code">foot</span>' or '<span class="code">meter</span>'. </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_direction </p>
      <p>Which measurement unit to be used for direction. The only option is "<span
          class="code">degree_compass</span>". </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_moisture </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for soil moisture. The only option is "<span
          class="code">centibar</span>." </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_percent </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for percentages. The only option is "<span
          class="code">percent</span>". </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_pressure </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for pressure. Possible options are one
        of "<span class="code">inHg</span>" (inches of mercury), "<span class="code">mbar</span>",
        or "<span class="code">hPa</span>." </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_radiation </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for radiation. The only option is "<span
          class="code">watt_per_meter_squared</span>." </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_rain </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for precipitation. Options are "<span class="code">inch</span>",
        "<span class="code">cm</span>," or "<span class="code">mm</span>." </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_rainrate </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for rate of precipitation. Possible
        options are one of "<span class="code">inch_per_hour</span>", "<span class="code">cm_per_hour</span>",
        or "<span class="code">mm_per_hour</span>". </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_speed </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for wind speeds. Possible options are
        one of "<span class="code">mile_per_hour</span>", "<span class="code">km_per_hour</span>",
        "<span class="code">knot</span>", or "<span class="code">meter_per_second</span>."
        </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_speed2 </p>
      <p>This group is similar to <span class="code">group_speed</span>, but is
        used for calculated wind speeds which typically have a slightly higher
        resolution. Possible options are one "<span class="code">mile_per_hour2</span>",
        "<span class="code">km_per_hour2</span>", "<span class="code">knot2</span>",
        or "<span class="code">meter_per_second2</span>". </p>
      <p><a class="config_important" name="group_temperature">group_temperature</a>
      </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for temperatures. Options are "<span class="code">degree_F</span>"
        or "<span class="code">degree_C</span>." </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_volt </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for voltages. The only option is "<span
          class="code">volt</span>." </p>
      <a name="Units_StringFormats"></a>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[StringFormats]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section is used to specify what string format is to be used
        for each unit when a quantity needs to be converted to a string.
        Typically, this happens with y-axis labeling on plots and for statistics
        in HTML file generation. For example, the options </p>
      <pre class="tty">degree_C = %.1f
inch     = %.2f</pre>
      <p>would specify that the given string formats are to be used when
        formatting any temperature measured in degrees Celsius or any
        precipitation amount measured in inches, respectively. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language">
          formatting codes are those used by Python</a>, a, and are very similar
        to C's <span class="code">sprintf()</span> codes. </p>
      <p>You can also specify what string to use for an invalid or unavailable
        measurement (value '<span class="code">None</span>'). For example, </p>
      <pre class="tty">NONE = " N/A "</pre>
      <a name="Units_Labels"></a>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Labels]]</h3>
      <p>This subsection specifies what label is to be used for each measurement
        unit type. For example, the options </p>
      <pre class="tty">degree_F = °F
inch     = ' in'</pre>
      <p>would cause all temperatures to have unit labels <span class="code">°F</span>
        and all precipitation to have labels <span class="code">in</span>. If
        any special symbols are to be used (such as the degree sign above) they
        should be encoded in UTF-8. This is generally what most text editors use
        if you cut-and-paste from a character map. Labels used in plot images
        will be converted to Latin-1 first (this is all the Python Imaging
        Library can handle). </p>
      <a name="Units_TimeFormats"></a>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[TimeFormats]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section is used for time labels. It uses <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-behavior">strftime()</a>
        formats. For example </p>
      <pre class="tty">week  = %H:%M on %A
month = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M</pre>
      <p>would specify that week data should use a format such as "<span class="code">15:20
          on Sunday</span>", while month data should look like "<span class="code">06-Oct-2009
          15:20</span>" </p>
      <p>It also allows the formatting to be set for almanac times: </p>
      <pre class="tty">ephem_day  = %H:%M
ephem_year = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M</pre>
      <p>The first of these, <span class="code">ephem_day</span>, is used for
        almanac times within the day, such as sunrise or sunset. The second, <span
          class="code">ephem_year</span>, is used for almanac times within the
        year, such as the next equinox or full moon. </p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Ordinates]]</h3>
      <p class="config_option">directions</p>
      <p>Set to the abbreviations to be used for ordinal directions. By default,
        this is <span class="code">N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW,
          SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW, N</span>.</p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[DegreeDays]]</h3>
      <p class="config_important">heating_base <br />
        cooling_base </p>
      <p>Set to the base temperature for calculating heating and cooling
        degree-days, along with the unit to be used. Examples:</p>
      <pre class="tty">heating_base = 65.0, degree_F
cooling_base = 20.0, degree_C</pre>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Trend]]</h3>
      <p class="config_option">time_delta</p>
      <p>Set to the time difference over which you want trends to be calculated.
        The default is 3 hours.</p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Labels]</h2>
      <p>This section sets the various labels to use. </p>
      <p class="config_option">hemispheres </p>
      <p>Comma separated list for the labels to be used for the four
        hemispheres. The default is "<span class="code">N, S, E, W</span>". </p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Generic]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-sections specifies default labels to be used for each SQL
        type. For example, options </p>
      <pre class="tty">inTemp = Temperature inside the house
outTemp = Outside Temperature</pre>
      <p>would cause the given labels to be used for plots involving SQL types <span
          class="code">inTemp </span>and <span class="code">outTemp</span>. </p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Almanac]</h2>
      <p>This section controls what text to use for the almanac. It consists of
        only one entry </p>
      <p class="config_option">moon_phases </p>
      <p>This option is a comma separated list of labels to be used for the
        eight phases of the moon. Default is "<span class="code">New, Waxing
          crescent, First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous, Last
          quarter, Waning crescent</span>". </p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[CheetahGenerator]</h2>
      <p>Before V2.5, this section was called <span class="code">[FileGenerator]</span>. 
	  Older versions and names are 100% backwards compatible.</p>
		<p>This section is used by generator <span class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</span>
        and controls text generation from templates, specifically which files
        are to be produced from which template. </p>
      <h3>Overview of file generation</h3>
      <p>Customization of file generation consists of playing with the various
        options offered below and, failing that, modifying the template files
        that come with the distribution. </p>
      <p>Each template file is named something like <span class="code"><em>D/F.E.tmpl</em></span>,
        where <span class="code">D</span> is the subdirectory the template sits
        in and will also be the subdirectory the results will be put in, and <span
          class="code">F.E</span> is the generated file name. So, given a
        template file with name <span class="code">Acme/index.html.tmpl</span>,
        the results will be put in <span class="symcode">$HTML_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/Acme/index.html</span>. </p>
      <p>The skin that comes with the standard distribution of <span class="code">
          weewx</span> contains three different kinds of generated output: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Summary by month. In addition to the naming rules above, if the
          template file has the letters <span class="code">YYYY</span> and <span
            class="code">MM</span> in its name, these will be substituted for
          the year and month, respectively. So, a template with the name <span
            class="code">summary-YYYY-MM.html.tmpl</span> would have name <span
            class="code">summary-2010-03.html</span> for the month of March,
          2010. The default distribution has been set up to produce NOAA monthly
          summaries, one for each month, as a simple text file (no HTML). </li>
        <li>Summary by year. In addition to the naming rules above, if the
          template file has the letters <span class="code">YYYY</span> in its
          name, the year will be substituted. The default distribution has been
          set up to produce NOAA yearly summaries, one for each year, as a
          simple text file (no HTML). </li>
        <li>Summary "To Date". The default distribution has been set up to
          produce reports for the day, week, month, and year-to-date
          observations. These four files are all HTML files. The first, the
          daily summary (output file i<span class="code">ndex.html</span>),
          includes a drop-down list that allows the NOAA month and yearly
          summaries to be displayed. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p class="config_option">encoding </p>
      <p>This option controls which encoding is to be used for the generated
        output. There are 3 possible choices: </p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 90%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Encoding</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Comments</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code" style="height: 53px">html_entities</td>
            <td style="height: 53px">Non 7-bit characters will be represented as HTML entities (<em>e.g.</em>,
              the degree sign will be represented as <span class="code">&amp;#176;</span>)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">utf8</td>
            <td>Non 7-bit characters will be represented in UTF-8.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">strict_ascii</td>
            <td>Non 7-bit characters will be ignored.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>By default, the encoding <span class="code">html_entities</span> is
        used for HTML files, <span class="code">strict_ascii</span> for the
        NOAA template files. </p>
		<p class="config_option">search_list</p>
		<p>This is the list of search list extensions that will be scanned by 
		the template engine, looking for tags. See the section <em>
		<a href="#Defining_new_tags">Defining new tags</a></em> and the 
		<a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org/docs/users_guide_html/users_guide.html">Cheetah documentation</a> for details on 
		search lists. The default list is:</p>
		<pre class="tty"> search_list = weewx.cheetahgenerator.Almanac, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Station, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Stats, weewx.cheetahgenerator.UnitInfo, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Extras, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Current</pre>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[SummaryByMonth]]</h3>
      <p>This section controls which summaries-by-month are generated. For each
        such summary, it should have its own sub-subsection, with option <span
          class="code">template</span> listing the template to be used. The
        default configuration generates NOAA-by-month summaries and is
        summarized below as an example. Additional "by month" summaries can be
        added easily by following the same pattern. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[NOAA_month]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">encoding </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">strict_ascii</span> for the NOAA monthly
        summary. </p>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>This option is set to the source template for the NOAA monthly summary,
        <span class="code">NOAA/NOAA-YYYY-MM.txt.tmpl</span>. </p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[SummaryByYear]]</h3>
      <p>This section controls which summaries-by-year are generated. For each
        such summary, it should have its own sub-subsection, with option <span
          class="code">template</span> listing the template to be used. The
        default configuration generates NOAA-by-year summaries and is summarized
        below as an example. Additional "by year" summaries can be added easily
        by following the pattern. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[NOAA_year]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">encoding </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">strict_ascii</span> for the NOAA year
        summary. </p>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>This option is set to the source template for the NOAA yearly summary,
        <span class="code">NOAA/NOAA-YYYY.txt.tmpl</span>. </p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[ToDate]]</h3>
      <p>This section controls which observations-to-date are generated. The
        default configuration generates four files: one for day, week, month,
        and year. Although the sub-subsections below have names such as 'week'
        or 'month', this is not used in their generation. Output is set by the
        template <em>content</em>, not the name of the sub-subsection — the
        names below could as easily have been 'Fred', 'Mary', 'Peter', and
        'George' and had the same output. </p>
      <p>Additional observations-to-date pages can be created easily by adding a
        new sub-subsection and giving it a unique name ("Jill"?), then giving
        the path to its template as option <span class="code">template</span>.
      </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[day]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">index.html.tmpl</span>, which contains the
        template for the day summary. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[week]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">week.html.tmpl</span>, which contains the
        template for the week summary. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[month]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">month.html.tmpl</span>, which contains the
        template for the month summary. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[year]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">year.html.tmpl</span>, which contains the
        template for the year summary. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[RSS]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">RSS/weewx_rss.xml.tmpl</span>, which
        contains a template for an RSS feed. </p>
      <h4 class="config_section">[[[Mobile]]]</h4>
      <p class="config_option">template </p>
      <p>Set to <span class="code">mobile.html.tmpl</span>, which contains a
        template for a page formatted for mobile phones. </p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[CopyGenerator]</h2>
      <p>This section is used by generator <span class="code">weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</span>
        and controls which files are to be copied over from the skin
        subdirectory to the destination directory. Think of it as "file
        generation," except that rather than going through the template engine,
        the files are simply copied over. </p>
      <p class="config_option">copy_once </p>
      <p>This option controls which files get copied over on the first
        invocation of the report engine service. Typically, this is things such
        as style sheets or background GIFs. Wildcards can be used. </p>
      <p class="config_option">copy_always </p>
      <p>This is a list of files that should be copied on every invocation.
        Wildcards can be used. </p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[ImageGenerator]</h2>
      <p>This section is used by generator <span class="code">weewx.reportengine.ImageGenerator</span>
        and controls which images (plots) get generated and with which options.
        While complicated, it is extremely flexible and powerful. </p>
      <h3>Time periods</h3>
      <p>The section consists of one or more sub-sections, one for each time
        period (day, week, month, and year). These sub-sections define the
        nature of aggregation and plot types for the time period. For example,
        here is a typical set of options for sub-section <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span>,
        controlling how images that cover a month period are generated: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[month_images]]
    x_label_format = %d
    bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M
    time_length = 2592000 # == 30 days
    aggregate_type = avg
    aggregate_interval = 10800 # == 3 hours</pre>
      <p>The option <span class="code">x_label_format</span> gives a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-behavior">strftime()</a>
        type format for the x-axis. In this example, it will only show days
        (format option "<span class="code">%d</span>"). The <span class="code">bottom_label_format</span>
        is the format used to time stamp the image at the bottom. In this
        example, it will show the time as <span class="code">10/25/09 15:35</span>.
        A plot will cover a nominal 30 days, and all items included in it will
        use an aggregate type of averaging over 3 hours. </p>
      <h3>Image files</h3>
      <p>Within each sub-section is another nesting, one for each image to be
        generated. The title of each sub-sub-section is the filename to be used
        for the image. Finally, at one additional nesting level (!) are the
        logical names of all the line types to be drawn in the image. Values
        specified in the level above can be overridden. For example, here is a
        typical set of options for sub-sub-section <span class="code">[[[monthrain]]]</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[monthrain]]]
    plot_type = bar
    yscale = None, None, 0.02
    [[[[rain]]]]
        aggregate_type = sum
        aggregate_interval = 86400
        label = Rain (daily avg)</pre>
      <p>This will generate an image file with name <span class="code">monthrain.png</span>.
        It will be a bar plot. Option <span class="code">yscale</span> controls
        the y-axis scaling — if left out, the scale will automatically be
        chosen. However, in this example we are choosing to exercise some degree
        of control by specifying values explicitly. The option takes a 3-way
        tuple (<span class="code">ylow</span>, <span class="code">yhigh</span>,
        <span class="code">min_interval</span>), where <span class="code">ylow</span>
        and <span class="code">yhigh</span> are the minimum and maximum y-axis
        values, respectively, and <span class="code">min_interval</span> is the
        minimum tick interval. If set to '<span class="code">None</span>', the
        corresponding value will be automatically chosen. So, in this example,
        the setting</p>
      <pre class="tty">yscale = None, None, 0.02</pre>
      <p>will cause <span class="code">weewx</span> to pick sensible y minimum
        and maximum values, but require that the tick increment (<span class="code">min_interval</span>)
        be at least 0.02. </p>
      <p>Continuing on with the example above, there will be only one plot
        "line" (it will actually be a series of bars) and it will have logical
        name "<span class="code">rain</span>". Because we have not said
        otherwise, the SQL data type to be used for this line will be the same
        as its logical name, that is, <span class="code">rain</span>, but this
        can be overridden (see below). The aggregation type will be summing
        (overriding the averaging specified in sub-section <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span>),
        so you get the total rain over the aggregate period (rather than the
        average) over an aggregation interval of 86,400 seconds (one day). The
        plot line will be titled with the indicated label ('<span class="code">Rain
          (daily avg)</span>') </p>
      <p>If there is a time gap in the data, the options <span class="code">line_gap_fraction</span>
        and <span class="code">bar_gap_fraction</span> control how it will be
        drawn. The former, <span class="code">line_gap_fraction</span>, is used
        for line graphs, the latter, <span class="code">bar_gap_fraction</span>,
        for bar graphs. Here's what the resultant plots look like without and
        with this option being specified:</p>
      <div class="center" style="width:80%;margin:0 auto;">
        <div style="float:left"> <img width="334" height="197" src="day-gap-not-shown.png"
            alt="Gap not shown" />
          <p class="caption"> No <span class="code">line_gap_fraction</span>
            specified</p>
        </div>
        <div> <img width="334" height="197" src="day-gap-showing.png" alt="Gap showing" />
          <p class="caption"> With <span class="code">line_gap_fraction=0.01</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both"></div>
      <h3>Including more than one SQL type in a plot</h3>
      <p>More than one SQL type can be included in a plot. For example, here is
        how to generate a plot with the week's outside temperature as well as
        dewpoint: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[monthtempdew]]]
    [[[[outTemp]]]]
    [[[[dewpoint]]]]</pre>
      <p>This would create an image in file <span class="code">monthtempdew.png</span>
        that includes a line plot of both outside temperature and dewpoint. </p>
      <h3>Including the same SQL type more than once in a plot</h3>
      <p>Another example. Say you want a plot of the day's temperature, overlaid
        with hourly averages. Here, you are using the same data type ('<span class="code">outTemp</span>')
        for both plot lines, the first with averages, the second without. If you
        do the obvious it won't work: </p>
      <pre class="tty">## WRONG ##
[[[daytemp_with_avg]]]
    [[[[outTemp]]]]
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 3600
    [[[[outTemp]]]]  # OOPS! The same section name appears more than once!</pre>
      <p>The option parser does not allow the same section name ('<span class="code">outTemp</span>'
        in this case) to appear more than once at a given level in the
        configuration file, so an error will be declared (technical reason:
        formally, the sections are an unordered dictionary). If you wish for the
        same SQL type to appear more than once in a plot then there is a trick
        you must know: use option <span class="code">data_type</span>. This
        will override the default action that the logical line name is used for
        the SQL type. So, our example would look like this: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[daytemp_with_avg]]]
    [[[[a_logical_name]]]]
        data_type = outTemp
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 3600
        label = Avg. Temp.
    [[[[outTemp]]]]</pre>
      <p>Here, the first logical line has been given the name "<span class="code">a_logical_name</span>"
        to distinguish it from the second line "<span class="code">outTemp</span>".
        We have specified that the first line will use data type <span class="code">
          outTemp</span> and that it will use averaging over a one hour period.
        The second also uses <span class="code">outTemp</span>, but will not
        use averaging. </p>
      <p>The result is a nice plot of the day's temperature, overlaid with a
        3-hour smoothed average: </p>
      <p class="center"> <img width="300" height="180" alt="Daytime temperature with running average"
          src="daytemp_with_avg.png" /> </p>
      <p>One more example. This one shows daily high and low temperatures for a
        year:</p>
      <pre class="tty">[[year_images]]
    ...
    [[[yearhilow]]]
        [[[[hi]]]]
            data_type = outTemp
            aggregate_type = max
            label = High
        [[[[low]]]]
            date_type = outTemp
            aggregate_type = min
           label = Low Temperature</pre>
      <p>This results in the plot <span class="code">yearhilow.png</span>:</p>
      <p class="center"><img width="300" height="180" alt="Daily highs and lows"
          src="yearhilow.png" /> </p>
      <h3>Progressive vector plots</h3>
      <p><span class="code">Weewx</span> can produce progressive vector plots as
        well as the more conventional x-y plots. To produce these, use plot type
        '<span class="code">vector</span>'. You need a vector type to produce
        this kind of plot. There are two: '<span class="code">windvec</span>',
        and '<span class="code">windgustvec</span>'. While they do not actually
        appear in the SQL database, <span class="code">weewx</span> understands
        that they represent special vector-types. The first, '<span class="code">windvec</span>',
        represents the average wind in an archive period, the second, '<span class="code">windgustvec</span>'
        the max wind in an archive period. Here's how to produce a progressive
        vector for one week that shows the hourly biggest wind gusts, along with
        hourly averages: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[weekgustoverlay]]]
    aggregate_interval = 3600
    [[[[windvec]]]]
        label = Hourly Wind 
        plot_type = vector
        aggregate_type = avg
    [[[[windgustvec]]]]
        label = Gust Wind 
        plot_type = vector
        aggregate_type = max</pre>
      <p>This will produce an image file with name <span class="code">weekgustoverlay.png</span>.
        It will consist of two progressive vector plots, both using hourly
        aggregation (3,600 seconds). For the first set of vectors, the hourly
        average will be used. In the second, the max of the gusts will be used:
      </p>
      <p class="center"> <img width="300" height="180" alt="hourly average wind vector overlaid with gust vectors"
          src="weekgustoverlay.png" /> </p>
      <p>By default, the sticks in the progressive wind plots point towards the
        wind source. That is, the stick for a wind from the west will point
        left. If you have a chronic wind direction (as I do), you may want to
        rotate the default direction so that all the vectors do not line up over
        the x-axis, overlaying each other. Do this by using option <span class="code">vector_rotate</span>.
        For example, with my chronic westerlies, I set <span class="code">vector_rotate</span>
        to 90.0 for the plot above, so winds out of the west point straight up.
      </p>
      <p>If you use this kind of plot (the out-of-the-box version of <span class="code">weewx</span>
        includes daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly progressive wind plots), a
        small compass rose will be put in the lower-left corner of the image to
        show the orientation of North. </p>
      <h3>Overriding values</h3>
      <p>Remember that values at any level can override values specified at a
        higher level. For example, say you want to generate the standard plots,
        but for a few key observation types such as barometer, you want to also
        generate some oversized plots to give you extra detail, perhaps for an
        HTML popup. The standard <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> file
        specifies plot size of 300x180 pixels, which will be used for all plots
        unless overridden: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Images]
    ...
    image_width=300

      <h1>Localization</h1>
      <p>Weewx has been designed to make localization fairly straightforward.
        What follows is a guide to localizing
        to a non-English language and/or locale.</p>
      <h2>Translate the templates</h2>
      <p>First, you will need to go through the templates and translate to your
        target language. Obvious text strings such as "<span class="code">Current
          Weather Conditions</span>" will need to be translated.</p>
      <h2>Modify skin.conf to reflect local conventions</h2>
      <p>Next, you will need to go through <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
        and modify options to follow local conventions. This includes dates and
        labels.</p>
      <h3>Dates</h3>
      <p>Date formats may need to be changed. For example, if you wish to follow
        the European convention Day/Month/Year, rather than the US convention of
        Month/Day/Year, then several lines in the <span class="code">[[TimeFormats]]</span>
        section may have to be changed. Note that the format for '<span class="code">week</span>'
        also includes the preposition '<span class="code">on</span>', which may
        have to be translated to your language.</p>
      <pre class="tty">    [[TimeFormats]]
        #
        # This section sets the string format to be used
        # each time scale.
        #
        day        = %H:%M
        week       = %H:%M on %A
        month      = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        year       = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        rainyear   = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        current    = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        ephem_day  = %H:%M
        ephem_year = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M</pre>
      <p>The bottom label format used in plots may need to be changed from</p>
      <pre class="tty">bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y</pre>
      <p>to</p>
      <pre class="tty">bottom_label_format = %d/%m/%y</pre>
      <h3>Labels</h3>
      <p>There are several almanac labels that may need to be changed. These
        include:</p>
      <pre class="tty">hemisphere = N, S, E, W</pre>
      <p>and</p>
      <pre class="tty">moon_phases = New, Waxing crescent, First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous, Last quarter, Waning crescent</pre>
      <p>You will also have to change the generic labels given to your weather
        observations:</p>
      <pre class="tty">        barometer      = Barometer
        dewpoint       = Dew Point
        heatindex      = Heat Index
        inHumidity     = Inside Humidity
        inTemp         = Inside Temperature
        outHumidity    = Outside Humidity
        outTemp        = Outside Temperature
        radiation      = Radiation
        rain           = Rain
        rainRate       = Rain Rate
        rxCheckPercent = ISS Signal Quality
        windDir        = Wind Direction
        windGust       = Gust Speed
        windGustDir    = Gust Direction
        windSpeed      = Wind Speed
        windchill      = Wind Chill
        windgustvec    = Gust Vector
        windvec        = Wind Vector
        extraTemp1     = Pond Temperature</pre>
      <h2>Environment variable <span class="code">LANG</span></h2>
      <p>Finally, you will need to set the environment variable <span class="code">LANG</span>
        to reflect your locale. For example, assuming you set</p>
      <pre class="tty">$ export LANG=es_ES.UTF-8</pre>
      <p>before running <span class="code">weewx</span>, then the local Spanish
        names for days of the week and months of the year will be used. The
        decimal point for numbers will also be modified appropriately.</p>
      <a name="service_engine"></a>
      <h1>Customizing the <span class="code">weewx</span> service engine</h1>
      <p>This is an advanced topic intended for those who wish to try their hand
        at extending the internal engine in weewx. You should have a passing
        familiarity with Python or, at least, be willing to learn it. </p>
      <p><em>Please note that the service engine is likely to change in future
          versions! </em></p>
      <p>At a high level, <span class="code">weewx</span> consists of an <em>engine</em>
        that is responsible for managing a set of <em>services</em>. A service
        consists of a Python class which binds its member functions to various <em>events</em>.
        The engine arranges to have the bound member function called when a
        specific event happens, such as a new LOOP packet arriving. </p>
      <p>To customize, you can </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customize a service </li>
        <li>Add a service </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The default install of <span class="code">weewx</span> includes the
        following services, shown in the order they are normally run:</p>

      <h2>Preserving your changes across an upgrade</h2>
      <p>Generally, if you change the code in <span class="code">weewx</span>
        you will have to cut-and-paste any changes you have made to the new
        code. However, if you put the changes in the special directory <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/user</span>, the installation routines will arrange for
        the changes to be preserved across an upgrade. </p>
      <h2>Customizing a Service</h2>
      <p>The service <span class="code">weewx.wxengine.StdPrint</span> prints
        out new LOOP and archive packets to the console when they arrive. By
        default, it prints out the entire record, which generally includes a lot
        of possibly distracting information and can be rather messy. Suppose you
        do not like this, and want it to print out only the time, barometer
        reading, and the outside temperature whenever a new LOOP packet arrives.
        This could be done by subclassing the default print service <span class="code">StdPrint</span>
        and overriding member function <span class="code">new_loop_packet()</span>.
      </p>
      <p>In file <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/user/myprint.py</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">from weewx.wxengine import StdPrint
from weeutil.weeutil import timestamp_to_string

class MyPrint(StdPrint):

    # Override the default new_loop_packet member function:
    def new_loop_packet(self, event):
    packet = event.packet
    print "LOOP: ", timestamp_to_string(packet['dateTime']),
        "BAR=",  packet.get('barometer', 'N/A'),
        "TEMP=", packet.get('outTemp', 'N/A')</pre>
      <p>This service substitutes a new implementation for the member function <span
          class="code">new_loop_packet</span>. This implementation prints out
        the time, then the barometer reading (or '<span class="code">N/A</span>'
        if it is not available) and the outside temperature (or '<span class="code">N/A</span>').</p>
      <p>You then need to specify that your print service class should be loaded
        instead of the default <span class="code">StdPrint</span> service. This
        is done by substituting your service name for <span class="code">StdPrint</span>
        in <span class="code">service_list</span>, located in <span class="code">[Engines][[WxEngine]]</span>:
      </p>

      <p>Note that the <span class="code">service_list</span> must be all on
        one line. Unfortunately, the parser <span class="code">ConfigObj</span>
        does not allow options to be continued on to following lines.</p>
      <h2>Adding a Service</h2>
      <p>Suppose there is no service that can be easily customized for your
        needs. In this case, a new one can easily be created by subclassing off
        the abstract base class <span class="code">StdService</span>, and then
        adding the functionality you need. Here is an example that implements an
        alarm that sends off an email when an arbitrary expression evaluates <span
          class="code">True</span>. This example is included in the standard
        distribution in subdirectory <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span

      <p>This service expects all the information it needs to be in the
        configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> in a new
        section called <span class="code">[Alarm]</span>. So, add the following
        lines to your configuration file: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Alarm]
    expression = "outTemp &lt; 40.0"
    time_wait = 3600
    smtp_host = smtp.mymailserver.com
    smtp_user = myusername
    smtp_password = mypassword
    mailto = auser@adomain.com, anotheruser@someplace.com
    from   = me@mydomain.com
    subject = "Alarm message from weewx!"</pre>
      <p>There are two important points to be noted in this example, each marked
        with a "<span class="code">NOTE</span>" flag in the code.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Here is where the binding happens between an event,
          weewx.NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD in this example, and a member function,
          self.newArchiveRecord. There are other events that can be
          interecepted. Look in the file <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
            class="code">/weewx/__init__.py</span>.</li>
        <li>This is where the test is done of whether or not to sound the alarm.
          The <span class="code">[Alarm]</span> configuration options specify
          that the alarm be sounded when "<span class="code">outTemp &lt; 40.0</span>"
          evaluates <span class="code">True</span>, that is when the outside
          temperature is below 40.0 degrees. Any valid Python expression can be
          used, although the only variables available are those in the current
          archive record.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Another example expression could be: </p>
      <pre class="tty">expression = "outTemp &lt; 32.0 and windSpeed &gt; 10.0"</pre>
      <p>In this case, the alarm is sounded if the outside temperature drops
        below freezing and the wind speed is greater than 10.0. </p>
      <p>Option <span class="code">time_wait</span> is used to avoid a flood of
        nearly identical emails. The new service will wait this long before
        sending another email out. </p>
      <p>Email will be sent through the SMTP host specified by option <span class="code">smtp_host</span>.
        The recipient(s) are specified by the comma separated option <span class="code">mailto</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Many SMTP hosts require user login. If this is the case, the user and
        password are specified with options <span class="code">smtp_user</span>
        and <span class="code">smtp_password</span>, respectively. </p>
      <p>The last two options, "<span class="code">from</span>" and "<span class="code">subject</span>"
        are optional. If not supplied, <span class="code">weewx</span> will
        supply something sensible. Note, however, that some mailers require a
        valid "from" email address and the one <span class="code">weewx</span>
        supplies may not satisfy its requirements. </p>
      <p>To make this all work, you must tell the engine to load this new
        service. This is done by adding your service name to the list <span class="code">service_list</span>,
        located in <span class="code">[Engines][[WxEngine]]</span>: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Engines]
   [[WxEngine]]
	service_list = weewx.wxengine.StdConvert, weewx.wxengine.StdCalibrate, weewx.wxengine.StdQC, weewx.wxengine.StdArchive, weewx.wxengine.StdTimeSynch, weewx.wxengine.StdPrint, weewx.wxengine.StdRESTful, weewx.wxengine.StdReport<span class="highlight">, examples.alarm.MyAlarm</span></pre>
      <p>Note that the <span class="code">service_list</span> must be all on
        one line. Unfortunately, the parser <span class="code">ConfigObj</span>
        does not allow options to be continued on to following lines.</p>
      <p>In addition to the example above, the distribution also includes a
        low-battery alarm (<span class="code">lowBattery.py</span>), which is
        very similar, except that it intercepts LOOP events (instead of
        archiving events). </p>

      <h1>Customizing the archive database</h1>
      <p>For most users the default database will work just fine. It has the
        added advantage of being compatible with the wview database.
        Nevertheless, there may be occasions where you may want to add a SQL
        type to your database, or change its unit system. This section shows you
        how to do this, using the utility <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/wee_config_database</span>.</p>
      <p>Before starting, it's worth running the utility with the <span class="code">--help</span>
        flag to see how it is used:</p>
      <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_database --help</pre>
      <h2>Adding a new observation type</h2>
      <p>Suppose you have installed an electric meter at your house and you wish
        to correlate electrical usage with the weather. The meter has some sort
        of connection to your computer, allowing you to download the
        consumption. At the end of every archive interval you want to sample the
        meter for the electricity consumed during the interval, then store the
        results in the archive database, along with the weather data. How would
        you do this?</p>
      <p>First, you would write a custom service that retrieves the electrical
        consumption data and adds it to the archive record. See the section <a
          href="#service_engine">Customizing the weewx service engine</a> for
        details on how to write a custom service. However, when you are done it
        will look something like this:</p>
      <pre class="tty">from weewx.wxengine import StdService
	
class AddElectricity(StdService):

    def new_archive_packet(self, event):

        (code that downloads the consumption data from the connection to the meter)

        event.record['electricity'] = retrieved_value</pre>
      <p>This adds a new key '<span class="code">electricity</span>' to the
        record dictionary and sets it equal to some value. As an aside, if you
        do something like this, you would want to make sure that the code to
        retrieve the current electrical consumption does not delay very long so
        it does not slow down the main loop. If it's going to cause a delay of
        more than a couple seconds you might want to put it in a separate thread
        and feed the results to <span class="code">AddElectricity</span>
        through a queue.</p>
      <p>As usual, you would add your new service to the option <span class="code">
          service_list</span> in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, making
        sure it appears before <span class="code">StdArchive</span> so your new
        value is inserted into the record <em>before</em> the data is archived.</p>
      <a name="add_archive_type"></a>
      <h3>Adding a new type to the archive database</h3>
      <p>So, now you have created a new observation type, '<span class="code">electricity</span>'.
        Trouble is, there is no corresponding type in the schema of the SQL
        database and, therefore, it won't be stored there. How would you add
        such a type?</p>
      <p>Here's our general strategy:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a new type to the database schema.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create the new
          database.</li>
        <li>Populate it with data from the old database.</li>
        <li>Shuffle databases around so <span class="code">weewx</span> will
          use the new database.</li>
        <li>Modify the stats database so it includes the new type as well
          (Optional).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>1. <strong>Adding a new type to the schema.</strong> When creating a
        database the schema is obtained from file <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/user/schemas.py</span>. Take a look at it now. You will
        see a list called <span class="code">defaultArchiveSchema</span> that
        holds all the observation names and their SQL types. It looks something
        like:</p>
      <pre class="tty">defaultArchiveSchema = [('dateTime',             'INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY'),
        ('usUnits',              'INTEGER NOT NULL'),
        ('interval',             'INTEGER NOT NULL'),
        ('barometer',            'REAL'),
        ('pressure',             'REAL'),
        ('altimeter',            'REAL'),
        ('inTemp',               'REAL'),
        ('outTemp',              'REAL'),
        ...
        ('inTempBatteryStatus',  'REAL')]</pre>
      <p>Let's modify it to add our new type, '<span class="code">electricity</span>'.
        Now it looks like this:</p>
      <pre class="tty">defaultArchiveSchema = [('dateTime',             'INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY'),
        ('usUnits',              'INTEGER NOT NULL'),
        ('interval',             'INTEGER NOT NULL'),
        ('barometer',            'REAL'),
        ('pressure',             'REAL'),
        ('altimeter',            'REAL'),
        ('inTemp',               'REAL'),
        ('outTemp',              'REAL'),
        ...
<span class="highlight">        ('electricity',          'REAL'),</span>
        ('inTempBatteryStatus',  'REAL')]</pre>
      <p>The new line has been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Check permissions.</strong> The reconfiguration utility
        will create a new database with the same name as the old, except with
        the suffix '<span class="code">_new</span>' attached to the end. Make
        sure you have the necessary permissions to do this. In particular, if
        you are using MySQL, you will need '<span class="code">CREATE</span>'
        privileges.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Run <span class="code">wee_config_database</span>.</strong>
        Now run the utility <span class="code">we-config-database.py</span>
        with the <span class="code">--reconfigure</span> option and the path to
        the configuration file:</p>
      <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_database --reconfigure <span
class="symcode">$CONFIG_ROOT</span>/weewx.conf</pre>
      <p>This will create a new database (nominally, <span class="code">weewx.sdb_new</span>
        if you are using sqlite, <span class="code">weewx_new</span> if you are
        using MySQL) using the new schema and populate it with data from the old
        database. </p>
      <p>4. <strong>Shuffle the databases.</strong> Now arrange things so <span
          class="code">weewx</span> can find the new database. </p>
      <p class="warning"><strong>Warning!</strong><br />
        Make a backup of the data before doing any of the next steps! </p>
      <p> You can either shuffle the databases around so the new database has
        the same name as the old database, or edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
        to use the new database name. To do the former:</p>
      <p>For sqlite:</p>
      <pre class="tty">cd <span class="symcode">$SQLITE_ROOT</span>
mv weewx.sdb_new weewx.sdb</pre>
      <p>For MySQL:</p>
      <pre class="tty">mysql -u &lt;username&gt; --password=&lt;mypassword&gt;
<span class="prompt">mysql&gt;</span> DROP DATABASE weewx;   # Drops the old database
<span class="prompt">mysql&gt;</span> CREATE DATABASE weewx; # Create a new one with the same name
<span class="prompt">mysql&gt;</span> RENAME TABLE weewx_new.archive TO weewx.archive;   # Rename to the nominal name</pre>
      <p>5. <strong>Modify the stats database.</strong> At this point, you can
        use the new observation type in the plots. However, if you wish to use
        it in the statistical summaries, you will also have to add it to the
        stats database. To do this, add the type to the Python list <span class="code">stats_types</span>,
        which can be found in <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/user/schemas.py</span>,
        so it reads something like this:</p>
      <pre class="tty">stats_types = ['barometer', 'inTemp', 'outTemp', 
    'inHumidity', 'outHumidity', 
    'rainRate', 'rain', 'dewpoint', 'windchill', 'heatindex', 'ET', 
    'radiation', 'UV', 'extraTemp1', 'rxCheckPercent', 'wind',
    <span class="highlight">'electricity'</span>]</pre>
      <p>Now delete the stats database (nominally <span class="code">stats.sdb</span>
        for sqlite, <span class="code">stats</span> for MySQL). Weewx will
        automatically rebuild it, including your new type.</p>
      <h3>Using the new type</h3>
      <p>Now you've added a new type. How do you use it? </p>
      <p>Pretty much like any other type. For example, to do a plot of the
        month's electric consumption, totaled by day, add this section to the <span
          class="code">[[month_images]]</span> section of <span class="code">skin.conf</span>:</p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[monthelectric]]]
    [[[[electricity]]]]
        aggregate_type = sum
        aggregate_interval = 86400
        label = Electric consumption (daily total)</pre>
      <p>This will cause the generation of an image <span class="code">monthelectric.png</span>,
        showing a plot of each day's consumption for the past month.</p>
      <p>If you wish to use the new type in the templates, it will be available
        using the same syntax as any other type. Here are some other tags that
        might be useful:</p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 80%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Tag</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$day.electricity.sum</td>
            <td>Total consumption since midnight</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.sum</td>
            <td>Total consumption since the first of the year</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.max</td>
            <td>The most consumed during any archive period</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.maxsum</td>
            <td>The most consumed during a day</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.maxsumtime</td>
            <td>The day it happened.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.sum_ge(5.0)</td>
            <td>The number of days where more than 5.0 kWH of energy was
              consumed.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h2>Changing the unit system</h2>
      <p>Normally, data is stored in the databases using US Customary units and,
        normally, you don't care --- data can always be displayed using any
        units you choose. It's an "implementation detail." Nevertheless, there
        may be special situations where you wish to store the data in Metric
        units. For example, you may need to allow direct programmatic access to
        the databases from another piece of software that expects metric units.
      </p>
      <p>Weewx does not allow you to change the database unit system midstream.
        You can't start with one unit system then, in the middle of the
        database, switch to another. See the section <span class="code"> <a href="usersguide.htm#StdConvert">[StdConvert]</a></span>
        in the Weewx User's Guide. However, you can reconfigure the database by
        coping it to a new database, performing the unit conversion along the
        way. You then use this new database.</p>
      <p>The steps are pretty much the same as <a href="#add_archive_type">Adding
          a New Type to the ArchiveDatabase</a>, described above.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Modify <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> to reflect your choice
          of the new unit system to use.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create the new
          database.</li>
        <li>Populate it with data from the old database.</li>
        <li>Shuffle databases around so <span class="code">weewx</span> will
          use the new database.</li>
        <li>Rebuild the stats database to use the new unit system.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>1. <strong>Modify <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.</strong> Edit
        the configuration file to change option <span class="code">target_unit</span>
        in section <span class="code"><a href="usersguide.htm#StdConvert">[StdConvert]</a></span>
        to reflect your choice. If you are switching to metric units, the option
        will look like</p>
      <pre class="tty">[StdConvert]
    target_unit = METRIC</pre>
      <p>2. <strong>Check permissions.</strong> The reconfiguration utility
        will create a new database with the same name as the old, except with
        the suffix '<span class="code">_new</span>' attached to the end. Make
        sure you have the necessary permissions to do this. In particular, if
        you are using MySQL, you will need '<span class="code">CREATE</span>'
        privileges.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Run <span class="code">wee_config_database</span>.</strong>
        Now run the utility <span class="code">wee_config_database</span> with
        the <span class="code">--reconfigure</span> option:</p>
      <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_database --reconfigure <span
class="symcode">$CONFIG_ROOT</span>/weewx.conf</pre>
      <p>This will create a new database (nominally, <span class="code">weewx.sdb_new</span>
        if you are using sqlite, <span class="code">weewx_new</span> if you are
        using MySQL), using the schema found in <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/user/schemas.py</span>, and populate it with data from
        the old database, while performing the unit conversion.</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Shuffle the databases.</strong> This is identical to the
        description above.</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Recreate the stats database.</strong> Delete the stats
        database, then let <span class="code">weewx</span> regenerate it. It
        will use the new unit system.</p>

      <h1>Porting to new weather station hardware</h1>
      <p>Naturally, this is an advanced topic but, nevertheless, I'd really like
        to encourage any Python wizards out there to give it a try. Of course, I
        have selfish reasons for encouraging you: I don't want to have to go out
        and buy every type of hardware there is! It's expensive and my roof
        would look like a weather station farm.</p>
      <p>Here's the general strategy for doing a port:</p>
      <p>Inherit from the abstract base class <span class="code">weewx.abstractstation.AbstractStation</span>.
        Try to implement as many of its methods as you can. At the very minimum,
        you must implement the following two: </p>
      <p><span class="code">hardware_name</span>: Return a string with a short
        nickname for the hardware, such as "<span class="code">ACME X90</span>"</p>
      <p><span class="code">genLoopPackets</span>: This should be a generator
        function that yields loop packets, one after another. Don't worry about
        stopping it: the engine will do this when an archive record is due. A
        loop packet is a dictionary. At the very minimum it must contain keys</p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 60%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">dateTime</td>
            <td>The time of the observation in unix epoch time.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">usUnits</td>
            <td>The unit system used. <span class="code">weewx.US</span> for US
              customary, <span class="code">weewx.METRIC</span> for metric. See
              the file <span class="code">units.py</span>, dictionaries <span
                class="code">USUnits</span> and <span class="code">MetricUnits</span>
              for the exact definition of each.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Then include any observation types you have in the dictionary. Every
        packet need not contain the same set of observation types. Different
        packets can use different unit systems, but all observations within a
        packet must use the same unit system. If your hardware has an error and
        you don't have a value, you can either leave it out of the dictionary or
        (preferred) set its value to <span class="code">None</span>.</p>
      <p>A couple of observation types are tricky. In particular, rain.
        Generally, <span class="code">weewx</span> expects to see a packet with
        the amount of rain that fell in that packet period included as
        observation '<span class="code">rain</span>'. It then sums up all the
        values to get the total rainfall and emits that in the archive record.
        If your hardware does not provide this value, you might have to infer it
        from changes in whatever value it provides, for example changes in the
        daily or monthly rainfall. I know this is not the best solution, but it
        is the most general solution. Any alternatives are welcome!</p>
      <p>Wind is another tricky one. It is actually broken up into four
        different observations: '<span class="code">windSpeed</span>', '<span class="code">windDir</span>',
        '<span class="code">windGust</span>', and '<span class="code">windGustDir</span>'.
        Supply as many as you can. The directions should be compass directions
        in degrees (0=North, 90=East, etc.).</p>
      <p>Be careful when reporting pressure. There are three observations
        related to pressure. Some stations report only the station pressure,
        others calculate and report sea level pressures. </p>
      <table class="center" style="width: 60%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">pressure</td>
            <td>The <em>Station Pressure</em> (SP), which is the raw, absolute
              pressure measured by the station. This is the true barometric
              pressure for the station.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">barometer</td>
            <td>The <em>Sea Level Pressure</em> (SLP) obtained by correcting
              the <em>Station Pressure</em> for altitude and local temperature.
              This is the pressure reading most commonly used by meteorologist
              to track weather systems at the surface, and this is the pressure
              that is uploaded to weather services by <span class="code">weewx</span>.
              It is the station pressure reduced to mean sea level using local
              altitude and local temperature. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">altimeter</td>
            <td>The <em>Altimeter Setting</em> (AS) obtained by correcting the
              <em>Station Pressure</em> for altitude. This is the pressure
              reading most commonly heard in weather reports. It is not the true
              barometric pressure of a station, but rather the station pressure
              reduced to mean sea level using altitude and an assumed
              temperature average.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="code">genArchiveRecords:</span> If your hardware does not
        have an archive record logger, then <span class="code">weewx</span> can
        do the record generation for you. It will automatically collect all the
        types it sees in your loop packets then emit a record with the averages
        (in some cases the sum or max value) of all those types. If it doesn't
        see a type, then it won't appear in the emitted record. If your hardware
        does have a logger, then you should implement method <span class="code">genArchiveRecords</span>
        as well. It should be a generator function that returns all the records
        since a given time. </p>
      <p><span class="code">loader:</span> This is a factory function that
        returns an instance of your driver. It has two arguments: the
        configuration dictionary, and a reference to the weewx engine.</p>
      <p>You then include a new section in the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
        that includes any options your driver needs. It should also include an
        entry '<span class="code">driver</span>' that points to where your
        driver can be found. Set option <span class="code">station_type</span>
        to your new section type and your driver will be loaded.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the simulator code in <span class="code">simulator.py</span>
        for a dirt simple example of a driver. The next most complicated is the
        driver for the WMR100 series, located in <span class="code">wmr100.py</span>.
        The driver for the Vantage series is by far the most complicated. It
        actually multi-inherits from not only <span class="code">AbstractStation</span>,
        but also <span class="code">StdService</span>. That is, it also
        participates in the engine as a service.</p>
      <p>Naturally, there are a lot of subtleties that I've glossed over in this
        high-level description. If you're game, give it a try — I'm happy to

      <h1>Appendix A: Archive Types</h1>
      <p><em>Archive types</em> are weather observations that have come from
        your instrument and been stored in the <em>archive database</em>, a SQL
        database. They represent the <em>current conditions</em> as of some
        time. They are available to be used in two places: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In your template files as a tag with period <span class="code">$current</span>.
          Hence, the tag <span class="code">$current.outTemp</span> represents
          the latest current outside temperature. There is no aggregation
          involved (see <a href="#statistical_types">statistical types</a> for
          aggregation). </li>
        <li>In your plot graphs. Here, a line in the graph represents the set of
          current observations over a time period. While each plot point in a
          graph may represent an aggregation, do not confuse this aggregation
          with the statistical aggregation. The former is done with the archive
          database, the latter with the statistical database. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following table shows all the possible archive types and whether
        they can be used in tag <span class="code">$current</span> or in a
        plot. Note that just because a type appears in the table does not
        necessarily mean that it is available for <em>your</em> station setup.
        That would depend on whether your instrument supports the type. </p>

      <h1>Appendix C: Statistical Types</h1>
      <p>Most of the templates are devoted to reporting <em>statistical types</em>,
        such as temperature, wind, or rainfall, using various <em>aggregates</em>,
        such as min, max, or sum. These are called <em>aggregations</em>,
        because they are a summary of lots of underlying data. However, only
        certain aggregates make sense for certain statistical types. For
        example, heat degree days is defined on a daily basis, so while the
        day's average temperature is meaningful, the day's heating degree days
        do not. </p>
      <p>The following table defines which aggregates are available to be used
        in your template for which statistical types (assuming your station
        supports them and you have specified that it be stored in your stats
        database. See section <span class="code"><a href="usersguide.htm#Stats">[Stats]</a></span>
        in the <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> configuration file). </p>

      <h1>Appendix D: Packet Types</h1>
      <p><em>Packets</em> are the raw data coming off the instrument (as opposed
        to <em>records</em>, which are stored on the database). The observation
        types available in a packet are useful when setting <em><a href="usersguide.htm#StdQC">quality
            control rules</a></em> and when doing <em> <a href="usersguide.htm#Calibrate">calibrations</a></em>.
      </p>
      <p>They may also be useful if you are writing your own custom service. In
        particular, for subclasses of <span class="code">StdService</span>,
        member function <span class="code">newLoopPacket</span> is called when
        new LOOP packets arrive, and member function <span class="code">newArchivePacket</span>
        is called when new archive packets arrive. For both functions, the only
        argument (besides <span class="code">self</span>) is a dictionary,
        where the key is the type listed below, and the value is the observation
        value. </p>
