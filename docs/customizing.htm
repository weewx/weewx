        <p>
            This document covers the customization of WeeWX. It assumes that you have read, and are
            reasonably familiar with, the <a href="usersguide.htm">Users Guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The introduction contains an overview of the architecture. If you are only interested
            in customizing the generated reports you can probably skip the introduction and proceed
            directly to the section <a href="#customizing_reports"><em>Customizing reports</em></a>.
            With this approach you can easily add new plot images, change the titles of images,
            change the units used in the reports, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if your goal is a specialized application, such as adding alarms, RSS feeds,
            <i>etc.</i>, then it would be worth your while to read about the internal architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the guide applies to any hardware, but the exact data types are
            hardware-specific. See the <a href="hardware.htm"><em>WeeWX Hardware Guide</em></a>
            for details of how different observation types are handled by different types hardware.
        </p>

        <p class="warning">
            <strong>Warning!</strong><br/> WeeWX is still an experimental system and, as such,
            its internal design is subject to change. Future upgrades may break any customizations
            you have done, particularly if they involve the API (skin customizations tend to be
            more stable).

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

        <h2>Overall system architecture</h2>

        <p>
            Below is a brief overview of the WeeWX system architecture, which is covered in much
            more detail in the rest of this document.
        </p>

        <div class="image image-right" style="width: 30%">
            <img src="images/pipeline.png" alt="The WeeWX pipeline"/>

            <div class="image_caption">A typical WeeWX pipeline. The actual pipeline depends
                on what extensions are in use. Data, in the form of LOOP packets and archive
                records, flows from top to bottom.</div>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A WeeWX process normally handles the monitoring of one station &mdash; <i>e.g.</i> a
                weather station. The process is configured using a file with the name
                <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
            </li>

            <li>
                A WeeWX process has at most one "driver" to communicate with the station hardware
                and receive "high resolution" (<i>i.e.</i> every few seconds) measurement data in
                the form of LOOP packets. The driver is single-threaded and blocking, so no more
                than one driver can run in a WeeWX process.
            </li>


            <li>
                LOOP packets may contain arbitrary data from the station/driver in the form of a
                Python dictionary. Each LOOP packet must contain a time stamp, and a unit system,
                in addition to any number of observations, such as temperature or humidity.
                For extensive types, such as rain, the packet contains the total amount of
                rain that fell during the observation period.
            </li>
            <li>
                WeeWX then compiles these LOOP packets into regularly spaced "archive records."
                For most types, the archive record contains the average value seen in all of the
                LOOP packets over the archive interval (typically 5 minutes). For extensive types,
                such as rain, it is the sum of all values over the archive interval.
            </li>
            <li>
                Internally, the WeeWX engine uses a <em>pipeline</em> architecture, consisting
                of many <em>services</em>. Services bind to events of interest, such as new
                LOOP packets, or new archive records. Events are then run down the pipeline
                in order &mdash; services at the top of the pipeline act on the data
                before services farther down the pipe.
            </li>

            <li>
                Services can do things such as check the data quality, apply corrections, or save
                data to a database. Users can easily add new services.
            </li>

            <li>
                WeeWX includes an ability to customize behavior by installing <em>extensions</em>.
                Extensions may consist of one or more drivers, services, and/or skins, all in an
                easy-to-install package.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="Data_architecture">Data architecture</h2>

        <p>
            WeeWX is data-driven. When the sensors spit out some data, WeeWX does something. The
            "something" might be to print out the data, or to generate an HTML report, or to use
            FTP to copy a report to a web server, or to perform some calculations using the data.
        </p>

        <p>
            A driver is Python code that communicates with the hardware. The driver reads data from
            a serial port or a device on the USB or a network interface. It handles any decoding of
            raw bits and bytes, and puts the resulting data into LOOP packets. The drivers for
            some kinds of hardware (most notably, Davis Vantage) are capable of emitting archive
            records as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the primary observation types such as temperature, humidity, or solar
            radiation, there are also many useful dependent types, such as wind chill, heat index,
            or ET, which are calculated from the primary data. The firmware in some weather
            stations are capable of doing many of these calculations on their own. For the rest,
            should you choose to do so, the WeeWX service <a
            href="usersguide.htm#StdWXCalculate"><span class="code">StdWXCalculate</span></a> can
            fill in the gaps. Sometimes the firmware simply does it wrong, and you may choose to
            have WeeWX do the calculation, despite the type's presence in LOOP packets.
        </p>

        <h2>LOOP packets <em>vs.</em> archive records </h2>

        <p>
            Generally, there are two types of data that flow through WeeWX: LOOP packets, and
            archive records. Both are represented as Python dictionaries.
        </p>

        <h3>LOOP packets</h3>
        <p>
            LOOP packets are the raw data generated by the device driver. They get their name from the Davis Instruments
            documentation. For some devices they are generated at rigid intervals, such as every 2 seconds for the Davis
            Vantage series, for others, irregularly, every 20 or 30 seconds or so. LOOP packets may or may not contain
            all the data types. For example, a packet may contain only temperature data, another only barometric data,
            <em>etc</em>. These kinds of packet are called <em>partial record packets</em>. By contrast, other types of
            hardware (notably the Vantage series), every LOOP packet contains every data type.
        </p>

        <p>In summary, LOOP packets can be highly irregular, but they come in frequently.</p>

        <h3>Archive records</h3>

        <p>
            By contrast, archive records are highly regular. They are generated at regular intervals (generally every 5
            to 30 minutes), and all contain the same data types. They represent an <em>aggregation</em> of the LOOP
            packets over the archive interval. The exact kind of aggregation depends on the data type. For example, for
            temperature, it's generally the average temperature over the interval. For rain, it's the sum of rain over
            the interval. For battery status it's the last value in the interval.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some hardware is capable of generating their own archive records (the Davis Vantage and
            Oregon Scientific WMR200, for example), but for hardware that cannot, WeeWX generates
            them.
        </p>

        <p>It is the archive data that is put in the SQL database, although, occasionally, the LOOP packets can be
            useful (such as for the Weather Underground's "Rapidfire" mode).
        </p>

        <h2>What to customize</h2>

        <p>
            For configuration changes, such as which skins to use, or enabling posts to the
            Weather Underground, simply modify the WeeWX configuration file
            <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. Any changes you make will be preserved during
            an upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customization of reports may require changes to a skin configuration file <span
            class="code">skin.conf</span> or template files ending in <span
            class="code">.tmpl</span> or <span class="code">.inc</span>. Anything in the <span
            class="code">skins</span> subdirectory is also preserved across upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may choose to install one of the many <a
            href="https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki#extensions-to-weewx">third-party
            extensions</a> that are available for WeeWX. These are typically installed in either
            the <span class="code">skins</span> or <span class="code">user</span> subdirectories,
            both of which are preserved across upgrades.
        </p>

        <p>
            More advanced customizations may require new Python code or modifications of
            example code. These should be placed in the <span class="code">user</span> directory,
            where they will be preserved across upgrades. For example, if you wish to modify one of
            the examples that comes with WeeWX, copy it from the <span class="code">examples</span>
            directory to the <span class="code">user</span> directory, then modify it there. This
            way, your modifications will not be touched if you upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
            For code that must run before anything else in WeeWX runs (for example, to set up an
            environment), put it in the file <span class="code">extensions.py</span> in the <span
            class="code">user</span> directory. It is always run before the WeeWX engine starts up.
            Because it is in the <span class="code">user</span> subdirectory, it is preserved
            between upgrades.
        </p>

        <h2>Do I need to restart WeeWX?</h2>
        <p>
            If you make a change in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, you will need to restart
            WeeWX.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you modify Python code in the <span class="code">user</span> directory or elsewhere,
            you will need to restart WeeWX.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you install an extension, you will need to restart WeeWX.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you make a change to a template or to a <span class="code">skin.conf</span> file,
            you do not need to restart WeeWX. The change will be adopted at the next reporting
            cycle, typically at the end of an archive interval.
        </p>
        <h2 id="wee_reports">
            The utility <span class="code">wee_reports</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
            If you make changes, how do you know what the results will look like? You could just run WeeWX and wait
            until the next reporting cycle kicks off but, depending on your archive interval, that could be a 30 minute
            wait or more.
        </p>

        <p>
            The utility <span class="code">wee_reports</span> allows you to run a report whenever you like. To use it,
            just run it from a command line, with the location of your configuration file <span
            class="code">weewx.conf</span> as the first argument. Optionally, if you include a unix epoch timestamp as a
            second argument, then the report will use that as the "Current" time; otherwise, the time of the last record
            in the archive database will be used. Here is an example, using 1 May 2014 00:00 PDT as the "Current" time.
        </p>

        <h2>The WeeWX service architecture</h2>

        <p>
            At a high-level, WeeWX consists of an engine class called <span class="code">StdEngine</span>. It is
            responsible for loading <em>services</em>, then arranging for them to be called when key events occur, such
            as the arrival of LOOP or archive data. The default install of WeeWX includes the following services:

        <p>
            It is easy to extend old services or to add new ones. The source distribution includes an example new
            service called <span class="code">MyAlarm</span>, which sends an email when an arbitrary expression
            evaluates <span class="code">True</span>. These advanced topics are covered later in the section <em><a

            The standard reporting service, <span class="code">StdReport</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
            For the moment, let us focus on the last service, <span class="code">weewx.engine.StdReport</span>, the
            standard service for creating reports. This will be what most users will want to customize, even if it means
            just changing a few options.
        </p>

        <h3>Reports</h3>

        <p>
            The standard reporting service, <span class="code">StdReport</span>, runs zero or more <em>reports</em>. The
            specific reports which get run are set in the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, in

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Note that the FTP and RSYNC "reports" are a funny kind of report in that it they do not actually generate
            anything. Instead, they use the reporting service engine to transfer files and folders to a remote server.
        </p>

        <h3>Skins</h3>

        <p>
            Each report has a <em>skin</em> associated with it. For most reports, the relationship with the skin is an
            obvious one: it contains the templates, any auxiliary files such as background GIFs or CSS style sheets, and
            a <em>skin configuration file</em>, <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. If you will, the skin controls the
            <em>look and feel </em>of the report. Note that more than one report can use the same skin. For example, you
            might want to run a report that uses US Customary units, then run another report against the same skin, but
            using metric units and put the results in a different place. All this is possible by either overriding
            configuration options in the WeeWX configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> or the skin
            configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
        </p>

        <p>Like all reports, the FTP and RSYNC "reports" also use a skin, and include a skin configuration file,
            although they are quite minimal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Skins live in their own directory called <span class='code'>skins</span>, whose location is referred to as
            <a href="#skin-root-description"> <span class="symcode">SKIN_ROOT</span></a>.

        </p>
        <div id="skin-root-description" class="modal-dialog">
            <div>
                <!--suppress HtmlUnknownAnchorTarget -->
                <a href="#close" title="Close" class="close-dialog">X</a>
                <h4>SKIN_ROOT</h4>
                <p>
                    The symbol <span class='code'>SKIN_ROOT</span> is a symbolic name to the location of the directory
                    where your skins are located. It is not to be taken literally. Consult the <a
                    href="usersguide.htm#dir-layout-table">directory layout table</a> in the User's Guide for its exact
                    location, dependent on how you installed WeeWX and what operating system you are using
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Generators</h3>

        <p>
            To create their output, skins rely on one or more <em>generators</em>, which are what do the actual work,
            such as creating HTML files or plot images. Generators can also copy files around or FTP/rsync them to
            remote locations. The default install of WeeWX includes the following generators:
        </p>
        <table class="indent">
            <tbody>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td>Generator</td>
                <td>Function</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</td>
                <td>Generates files from templates, using the Cheetah template engine. Used to generate HTML and text
                    files.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">weewx.imagegenerator.ImageGenerator</td>
                <td>Generates graph plots.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">weewx.reportengine.FtpGenerator</td>
                <td>Uploads data to a remote server using FTP.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">weewx.reportengine.RsyncGenerator</td>
                <td>Uploads data to a remote server using rsync.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</td>
                <td>Copies files locally.</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            Note that the three generators <span class="code">FtpGenerator</span>, <span
            class="code">RsyncGenerator</span>, and <span class="code">CopyGenerator</span> do not actually generate
            anything having to do with the presentation layer. Instead, they just move files around.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which generators are to be run for a given skin is specified in the skin's configuration file <span
            class="code">skin.conf</span>, in section <a href="#generators_section"><span
            class="code">[Generators]</span></a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Templates</h3>

        <p>
            A template is a text file that is processed by a <em>template engine</em> to create a new file. WeeWX uses
            the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Cheetah/">Cheetah</a> template engine. The generator <span
            class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</span> is responsible for running Cheetah at
            appropriate times.
        </p>

        <p>A template may be used to generate HTML, XML, CSV, Javascript, or any other type of text file. A template
            typically contains variables that are replaced when creating the new file. Templates may also contain simple
            programming logic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each template file lives in the skin directory of the skin that uses it. By convention, a template file ends
            with the <span class="code">.tmpl</span> extension. There are also template files that end with the <span
            class="code">.inc</span> extension. These templates are included in other templates.
        </p>

        <h2>The database</h2>

        <p>
            WeeWX uses a single database to store and retrieve the records it needs. It can be implemented by using
            either <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLITE3</a>, an open-source, lightweight SQL database, or <a
            href="http://www.mysql.com/"> MySQL</a>, an open-source, full-featured database server.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>

        <p>
            Inside this database are several tables. The most important is the <em>archive table</em>, a big flat table,
            holding one record for each archive interval, keyed by <span class="code">dateTime</span>, the time at the
            end of the archive interval. It looks something like this:
        </p>

        <table class="indent fixed_width">
            <caption>
                Structure of the <span class="code">archive</span> database table
            </caption>
            <tr class="code first_row">
                <td>dateTime</td>
                <td>usUnits</td>
                <td>interval</td>
                <td>barometer</td>
                <td>pressure</td>
                <td>altimeter</td>
                <td>inTemp</td>
                <td>outTemp</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>

            <tr class="code">
                <td>1413937800</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>29.938</td>
                <td><em>null</em></td>
                <td><em>null</em></td>
                <td>71.2</td>
                <td>56.0</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="code">
                <td>1413938100</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>29.941</td>
                <td><em>null</em></td>
                <td><em>null</em></td>
                <td>71.2</td>
                <td>55.9</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="code">
                <td>...</td>
                <td>...</td>

                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            The first three columns are <em>required.</em> Here's what they mean:
        </p>
        <table class="indent">
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td>Name</td>
                <td>Meaning</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="first_col code">dateTime</td>
                <td>The time at the end of the archive interval in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix
                    epoch time</a>. This is the <em>primary key</em> in the database. It must be unique, and it cannot
                    be null.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="first_col code">usUnits</td>
                <td>The unit system the record is in. It cannot be null. See the <em><a href="#units">Appendix:
                    Units</a></em> for how these systems are encoded.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="first_col code">interval</td>
                <td>The length of the archive interval in <em>minutes</em>. It cannot be null.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            In addition to the main archive table, there are a number of smaller tables inside the database, one for
            each observation type, that hold <em>daily summaries</em> of the type. For example, the minimum and maximum
            value seen during the day, and at what time. These tables have names such as <span class="code">archive_day_outTemp</span>
            or <span class="code">archive_day_barometer</span>. Their existence is generally transparent to the user.
        </p>

        <h3 id="binding_names">Binding names</h3>

        <p>
            While most users will only need the one weather database that comes with WeeWX, the reporting engine allows
            you to use multiple databases in the same report. For example, if you have installed the <a
            href="https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/cmon"><span class="code">cmon</span></a> computer monitoring
            package, which uses its own database, you may want to include some statistics or graphs about your server in
            your reports, using that database.
        </p>

        <p>
            An additional complication is that WeeWX can use more than one database implementation: SQLite or MySQL.
            Making users specify in the templates not only which database to use, but also which implementation, would
            be unreasonable.
        </p>

        <p>
            The solution, like so many other problems in computer science, is to introduce another level of indirection,
            a <em>database binding</em>. Rather than specify which database to use, you specify which <em>binding</em>
            to use. Bindings do not change with the database implementation, so, for example, you know that <span
            class="code">wx_binding</span> will always point to the weather database, no matter if its implementation is
            a sqlite database or a MySQL database. Bindings are listed in section <a href="usersguide.htm#DataBindings"><span
            class="code">[DataBindings]</span></a> in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The standard weather database binding that WeeWX uses is <span class="code">wx_binding</span>. This is the
            binding that you will be using most of the time and, indeed, it is the default. You rarely have to specify
            it explicitly.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming interface</h3>

        <p>
            WeeWX includes a module called <span class='code'>weedb</span> that provides a single interface for many of
            the differences between database implementations such as SQLite and MySQL. However, it is not uncommon to
            make direct SQL queries within services or search list extensions. In such cases, the SQL should be generic
            so that it will work with every type of database.
        </p>

        <p>The database manager class provides methods to create, open, and query a database. These are the canonical
            forms for obtaining a database manager.
        </p>

        <p>If you are opening a database from within a WeeWX service:</p>
        <pre class='tty'>db_manager = self.engine.db_binder.get_manager(data_binding='name_of_binding', initialize=True)

# Sample query:
db_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(rain) FROM %s "\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % db_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))</pre>
        <p>
            If you are opening a database from within a WeeWX search list extension, you will be passed in a function
            <span class="code">db_lookup()</span> as a parameter, which can be used to bind to a database. By default,
            it returns a manager bound to <span class="code">wx_binding</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class='tty'>wx_manager    = db_lookup()                                    # Get default binding
other_manager = db_lookup(data_binding='some_other_binding')   # Get an explicit binding

# Sample queries:
wx_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(rain) FROM %s "\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % wx_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))
other_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(power) FROM %s"\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % other_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))</pre>
        <p>
            If opening a database from somewhere other than a service, and there is no <span
            class="code">DBBinder</span> available:
        </p>
        <pre class='tty'>db_manager = weewx.manager.open_manager_with_config(config_dict, data_binding='name_of_binding')

# Sample query:
db_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(rain) FROM %s "\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % db_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))</pre>
        <p>
            The <span class="code">DBBinder</span> caches managers, and thus database connections. It cannot be shared
            between threads.
        </p>

        <h2>Units</h2>

        <p>
            The unit architecture in WeeWX is designed to make basic unit conversions and display of units easy. It is
            not designed to provide dimensional analysis, arbitrary conversions, and indications of compatibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <em>driver</em> reads observations from an instrument and converts them, as necessary, into a standard
            set of units. The actual units used by each instrument vary widely; some instruments use Metric units,
            others use US Customary units, and many use a mixture. The driver ensures that the units are consistent for
            storage in the WeeWX database. By default, and to maintain compatibility with <span
            class='code'>wview</span>, the default database units are US Customary, although this can be changed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that whatever unit system is used in the database, data can be <em>displayed</em> using any unit
            system. So, in practice, it does not matter what unit system is used in the database.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each <em>observation type</em>, such as <span class='code'>outTemp</span> or <span
            class='code'>pressure</span>, is associated with a <em>unit group</em>, such as <span class='code'>group_temperature</span>
            or <span class='code'>group_pressure</span>. Each unit group is associated with a <em>unit type</em> such as
            <span class='code'>degree_F</span> or <span class='code'>mbar</span>. The reporting service uses this
            architecture to convert observations into a target unit system, to be displayed in your reports.
        </p>

        <p>With this architecture one can easily create reports with, say, wind measured in knots, rain measured in mm,
            and temperatures in degree Celsius. Or one can create a single set of templates, but display data in
            different unit systems with only a few stanzas in a configuration file.
        </p>


        <h1 id="customizing_reports">Customizing reports</h1>

        <p>
            There are two general mechanisms for customizing reports: change options in one or more configuration files,
            or change the template files. The former is generally easier, but occasionally the latter is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            Options are specified in configuration files and are organized hierarchically into stanzas. For example, the
            <span class="code">[Labels]</span> stanza contains the text that should be displayed for each observation.
            The <span class="code">[Units]</span> stanza contains other stanzas, each of which contains parameters that
            control the display of units.
        </p>

        <h2 id="How_options_work">How options work</h2>

        <p>
            Options are used in WeeWX to specify how your reports will look and what they will contain. For example,
            they control what units to use, how to format a string, which plot lines to include, and what color they
            should be, <em>etc</em>. They all work the same way and obey a hierarchy, allowing skin authors to specify a
            look and feel of a report, while ensuring that you still have the final say of how it will come out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are the places where options are specified, including their <em>scope</em> and <em>precedence</em>,
            listed in order of decreasing precedence.

        <p>
            You must pay attention to the number of brackets! In the table above, there are two different nesting depths
            used: one for <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, and one for <span class="code">weewx/defaults.py</span>
            and <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. This is because the stanzas defined in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            start two levels down in the hierarchy <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>, whereas the stanzas defined in
            <span class="code">skin.conf</span> and <span class="code">defaults.py</span> are at the root level.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how_to_change_labels">Changing labels</h2>
        <p>
            Let's look at an example. If you take a look inside the file <span class="code">weewx/defaults.py</span>,
            you will see it contains what looks like a big configuration file. Among other things, it has two entries
            that look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
...
[Labels]
    ...
    [[Generic]]
        ...
        inTemp = Inside Temperature
        outTemp = Outside Temperature
        ...</pre>

        <p>
            This tells the report generators that when it comes time to label the observation variables <span
            class="code">inTemp</span> and <span class="code">outTemp</span>, use the strings
            <span class="code">Inside Temperature</span> and <span class="code">Outside Temperature</span>,
            respectively. Because <span class="code">weewx/defaults.py</span> has the lowest precedence, these strings
            will be used only when nothing else is available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now suppose we have a skin called <em>Life</em> . Its configuration file will be located at <span
            class="code">skins/Life/skin.conf</span>. Suppose, among other things, it contains an excerpt
        </p>

        <pre class="tty">
...
[Labels]
    ...
    [[Generic]]
        ...
        outTemp = Exterior Temperature
</pre>

        <p>
            What this says is that the author of <span class="code">Life</span>, for whatever reasons, decided that s/he
            wants to use the string <span class="code">Exterior Temperature</span>, instead of <span class="code">Outside Temperature</span>
            for the label for <span class="code">outTemp</span>. The file includes no definition for <span class="code">inTemp</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, for purposes of illustrating precedence, suppose the <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> section
            of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> contains this:
        </p>

        <pre class="tty">
[StdReport]
    ...

    [[LifeA]]
        skin = Seasons

    [[LifeB]]
        skin = Life
        [[[Labels]]]
            [[[[Generic]]]]
                outTemp = Barn Temperature
</pre>

        <p>
            This will result in reports with the following values:
        </p>

        <table class="indent" style="width: 80%">
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td>Report</td>
                <td>Label for <span class="code">inTemp</span></td>
                <td>Label for <span class="code">outTemp</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>LifeA</td>
                <td>Inside Temperature</td>
                <td>Exterior Temperature</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>LifeB</td>
                <td>Inside Temperature</td>
                <td>Barn Temperature</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            Note how the values specified for <span class="code">inTemp</span> are not overridden anywhere, so the value
            specified in <span class="code">weewx/defaults.py</span>, that is, <span
            class="code">Inside Temperature</span>, is used. By contrast, a value for <span class="code">outTemp</span>
            was specified in the skin so, in the absence of any user override, its value, <span class="code">Exterior
            Temperature</span> will be used as the new default. Finally, for the report <span class="code">LifeB</span>,
            the user <em>has</em> specified an override for <span class="code">outTemp</span>, so that value,
            <span class="code">Barn Temperature</span>, is used.
        </p>

        <p>
            One more example. This time, suppose the <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> section of <span
            class="code">weewx.conf</span> contains this:
        </p>

        <pre class="tty">
[StdReport]
    ...

<span class="highlight">    [[Defaults]]
        [[[Labels]]]
            [[[[Generic]]]]
                outTemp = Shed Temperature</span>

    [[LifeA]]
        skin = Seasons

    [[LifeB]]
        skin = Life
        [[[Labels]]]
            [[[[Generic]]]]
                outTemp = Barn Temperature
</pre>
        <p>
            We have added a new section (<span class="highlight">highlighted</span>), where the user has specified a new
            default for the observation type <span class="code">outTemp</span>, that is, <span class="code">Shed Temperature</span>.
            Unless overridden, this is the value that will now be used instead of what the skin author specified. The
            final tally looks like this:
        </p>

        <table class="indent" style="width: 80%">
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td>Report</td>
                <td>Label for <span class="code">inTemp</span></td>
                <td>Label for <span class="code">outTemp</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>LifeA</td>
                <td>Inside Temperature</td>
                <td>Shed Temperature</td>
            </tr>

        <h2 id="how_to_change_units">How to change units</h2>

        <p>
            Some users prefer to see metric units, others prefer US customary units. And there are other cases where
            metric/US is not enough; some sites need metric units for most measurements, but wind speeds in <span
            class="code">knots</span>, or some sites need rainfall in <span class="code">mm</span> whereas others need
            <span class="code">cm</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section shows how to specify exactly what units you want to use for which reports. The examples use the
            skin <em>Seasons</em>, which comes with the distribution.
        </p>

        <h3 id="change_defaults">Change units for all reports </h3>
        <p>
            With this approach, you change an option under the <span class="code">[[Defaults]]</span> subsection,
            located under <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> in <span class="code">weewx.conf.</span> Changes here
            will affect <em>all</em> reports.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, suppose you wish to use metric units for all your reports, instead of the default US Customary
            Units. The section that controls units is <span class="code">[StdReport] / [[Defaults]] / [[[Units]]] / [[[[Groups]]]]</span>.
            It looks like this:

            reports.

        <h3 id="change_units">Change units for a single report </h3>

        <p>
            With this approach you can change an option for a single report.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose you want two reports, one in US Customary, the other in Metric. The first, call it <em>SeasonsUSReport</em>,
            will go in the regular directory <span class="symcode">HTML_ROOT</span>. However, the latter, call it <em>SeasonsMetricReport</em>,
            will go in a subdirectory, <span class="symcode">HTML_ROOT</span><span class="code">/metric</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To accomplish this, we will generate two reports, one using the defaults, the other using overrides to
            change the target unit system and the target directory. The section <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>

</pre>
        <p>
            Two things are different from the stock section <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>. First (1), we have
            renamed the first report from <em>SeasonsReport</em> to <em>SeasonsUSReport</em> for clarity; and second
            (2), we have introduced a new report <em>SeasonsMetricReport</em>, which is just like the first, except it
            puts its results in a different subdirectory and uses different units. Both use the same skin, the <em>Seasons</em>
            skin.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason this works is that the report <em>SeasonsUSReport</em> uses all of the defaults, which include US
            Customary units, and the default value for <a href="usersguide.htm#HTML_ROOT"><span
            class="code">HTML_ROOT</span></a> (which specifies the location for where HTML files are to be put).
        </p>

        <p>
            By contrast, <em>SeasonsMetricReport</em> cannot use these defaults, so it overrides the units to be used,
            and the value of <span class="code">HTML_ROOT</span>.
        </p>


        <h2 id="customizing_gen_time">Scheduling report generation</h2>

        <p>
            Normal WeeWX operation is to run each <em><a href="usersguide.htm#Reports">report</a></em> defined in <span
            class="code">weewx.conf</span> every archive period. While this may suit most situations, there may be
            occasions when it is desirable to run a report less frequently than every archive period. For example, the
            archive interval might be 5 minutes, but you only want to FTP files every 30 minutes, once per day, or at a
            set time each day. WeeWX has two mechanisms that provide the ability to control when files are generated.
            The <em><a href="#stale_age"><span class="code">stale_age</span></a></em> option allows control over the age
            of a file before it is regenerated, and the <span class="code">report_timing</span> option allows precise
            control over when individual reports are run.
        </p>

        <p class="note" style="display: inline-block; width: 70%">
            <strong>Note</strong><br/>While <span class="code">report_timing</span> specifies when a given report
            should be generated, the generation of reports is still controlled by the WeeWX report cycle, so reports can
            never be generated more frequently than once every archive period.
        </p>

        <h3>The <span class="code">report_timing</span> option</h3>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">report_timing</span> option uses a CRON-like format to control when a report is to be
            run. While a CRON-like format is used, the control of WeeWX report generation using the <span
            class="code">report_timing</span> option is confined completely to WeeWX and has no interraction with the
            system CRON service.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">report_timing</span> option consists of five parameters separated by white-space:
        </p>

        <pre class="tty">report_timing = minutes hours day_of_month months day_of_week</pre>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">report_timing</span> parameters are summarised in the following table:
        </p>

        </table>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">report_timing</span> option may only be used in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
            When set in the <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> section of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> the
            option will apply to all reports listed under <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>. When specified within a
            report section, the option will override any setting in <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> for that
            report. In this manner it is possible to have different reports run at different times. The following sample
            <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> excerpt illustrates this:
        </p>

        <pre class="tty">
[StdReport]

    # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT
    SKIN_ROOT = skins

    # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT
    HTML_ROOT = public_html

    # The database binding indicates which data should be used in reports.
    data_binding = wx_binding

    # Report timing parameter
    report_timing = 0 * * * *

    # Each of the following subsections defines a report that will be run.

    [[AReport]]
        skin = SomeSkin

    [[AnotherReport]]
        skin = SomeOtherSkin
        report_timing = */10 * * * *</pre>

        <p>
            In this case, the <span class="code">[[AReport]]</span> report would be run under under control of the <span
            class="code">0 * * * *</span> setting (on the hour) under <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> and the
            <span class="code">[[AnotherReport]]</span> report would be run under control of the <span class="code">*/10 * * * *</span>
            setting (every 10 minutes) which has overriden the <span class="code">[StdReport]</span> setting.
        </p>

        <h3>How <span class="code">report_timing</span> controls reporting </h3>

        <p>
            The syntax and interpretation of the <span class="code">report_timing</span> parameters are largely the same
            as those of the CRON service in many Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The syntax and interpretation are
            outlined below.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the <span class="code">report_timing</span> option is in use WeeWX will run a report when the minute,
            hour and month of year parameters match the report time, and at least one of the two day parameters (day of
            month or day of week) match the report time. This means that non-existent times, such as "missing hours"
            during daylight savings changeover, will never match, causing reports scheduled during the "missing times"
            not to be run. Similarly, times that occur more than once (again, during daylight savings changeover) will
            cause matching reports to be run more than once.
        </p>

        <p class="note" style="display: inline-block; width: 70%">
            <strong>Note</strong><br/>Report time does not refer to the time at which the report is run, but rather the
            date and time of the latest data the report is based upon. If you like, it is the effective date and time of
            the report. For normal WeeWX operation, the report time aligns with the <span class="code">dateTime</span>
            of the most recent archive record. When reports are run using the <span class="code">wee_reports</span>
            utility, the report time is either the <span class="code">dateTime</span> of the most recent archive record
            (the default) or the optional timestamp command line argument.
        </p>

        <p class="note" style="display: inline-block; width: 70%">
            <strong>Note</strong><br/>The day a report is to be run can be specified by two parameters; day of month
            and/or day of week. If both parameters are restricted (i.e., not an asterisk), the report will be run when
            either field matches the current time. For example,<br/> <span class="code">report_timing = 30 4
          1,15 * 5</span><br/> would cause the report to be run at 4:30am on the 1st and 15th of each month as well as
            4:30am every Friday.
        </p>

        <h3>The relationship between <span class="code">report_timing</span> and archive period </h3>

        <p>
            A traditional CRON service has a resolution of one minute, meaning that the CRON service checks each minute
            as to whether to execute any commands. On the other hand, the WeeWX report system checks which reports are
            to be run once per archive period, where the archive period may be one minute, five minutes, or some other
            user defined period. Consequently, the <span class="code">report_timing</span> option may specify a report
            to be run at some time that does not align with the WeeWX archive period. In such cases the <span
            class="code">report_timing</span> option does not cause a report to be run outside of the normal WeeWX
            report cycle, rather it will cause the report to be run during the next report cycle. At the start of each
            report cycle, and provided a <span class="code">report_timing</span> option is set, WeeWX will check each
            minute boundary from the current report time back until the report time of the previous report cycle. If a
            match is found on <strong>any</strong> of these one minute boundaries the report will be run during the
            report cycle. This may be best described through some examples:
        </p>

        <h3>Lists, ranges and steps</h3>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">report_timing</span> option supports lists, ranges, and steps for all parameters.
            Lists, ranges, and steps may be used as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Lists</em>. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas, for example <span class="code">1, 2,
                5, 9</span> or <span class="code">0-4, 8-12</span>. A match with any of the elements of the list will
                result in a match for that particular parameter. If the examples were applied to the minutes parameter,
                and subject to other parameters in the <span class="code">report_timing</span> option, the report would
                be run at minutes 1, 2, 5, and 9 and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 respectively. Abbreviated month
                and day names cannot be used in a list.
            </li>

            <li>
                <em>Ranges</em>. Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen, for example <span
                class="code">8-11</span>. The specified range is inclusive. A match with any of the values included in
                the range will result in a match for that particular parameter. If the example was applied to the hours
                parameter, and subject to other parameters in the <span class="code">report_timing</span> option, the
                report would be run at hours 8, 9, 10, and 11. A range may be included as an element of a list.
                Abbreviated month and day names cannot be used in a range.
            </li>

            <li>
                <em>Steps</em>. A step can be used in conjunction with a range or asterisk and are denoted by a '<span
                class="code">/</span>' followed by a number. Following a range with a step specifies skips of the step
                number's value through the range. For example, <span class="code">0-12/2</span> used in the hours
                parameter would, subject to other parameter in the <span class="code">report_timing</span> option, run
                the report at hours 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. Steps are also permitted after an asterisk in which case the
                skips of the step number's value occur through the all possible values of the parameter. For example,
                <span class="code">*/3</span> can be used in the hours parameter to, subject to other parameter in the
                <span class="code">report_timing</span> option, run the report at hours 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nicknames</h3>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">report_timing</span> option supports a number of time specification 'nicknames'.
            These nicknames are prefixed by the '<span class="code">@</span>' character and replace the five parameters

        <h1 id="customizing_templates">The Cheetah generator</h1>

        <p class="note">
            This section gives an overview of the Cheetah generator. For details about each of its various options, see
            the section <a href="#CheetahGenerator"><em>[CheetahGenerator]</em></a> in the <a
            href="#report_options"><em>Reference: report options</em></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            File generation is done using the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Cheetah/">Cheetah</a> templating engine,
            which processes a <em>template</em>, replacing any symbolic <em>tags</em>, then produces an output file.
            Typically, it runs after each new archive record (usually about every five minutes), but it can also run on
            demand using the <span class="code">wee_reports</span> utility.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Cheetah engine is very powerful, essentially letting you have the full semantics of Python available in
            your templates. As this would make the templates incomprehensible to anyone but a Python programmer, WeeWX
            adopts a very small subset of its power.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Cheetah generator is controlled by the section <a href="#CheetahGenerator"><span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span></a>.
            Let's take a look at how this works.
        </p>

        <h2>Which files get processed?</h2>

        <p>
            Each template file is named something like <span class="code"><em>D/F.E.tmpl</em></span>, where <span
            class="code">D</span> is the (optional) directory the template sits in and will also be the directory the
            results will be put in, and <span class="code">F.E</span> is the generated file name. So, given a template
            file with name <span class="code">Acme/index.html.tmpl</span>, the results will be put in <span
            class="symcode">HTML_ROOT</span><span class="code">/Acme/index.html</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The configuration for a group of templates will look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]
    [[index]]
        template = index.html.tmpl
    [[textfile]]
        template = filename.txt.tmpl
    [[xmlfile]]
        template = filename.xml.tmpl</pre>
        <p>
            There can be only one <span class="config_option">template</span> in each block. In most cases, the block
            name does not matter &mdash; it is used only to isolate each template. However, there are four block names
            that have special meaning: <span class="code">SummaryByDay</span>, <span class='code'>SummaryByMonth</span>,
            <span class='code'>SummaryByYear</span>, and <span class='code'>ToDate</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>Specifying template files</h3>

        <p>
            By way of example, here is the <span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span> section from the <span
            class="code">skin.conf</span> for the skin <em>Seasons</em>.
        </p>

        <pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]
    # The CheetahGenerator creates files from templates.  This section
    # specifies which files will be generated from which template.

    # Possible encodings are 'html_entities', 'utf8', or 'strict_ascii'
    encoding = html_entities

    [[SummaryByMonth]]
        # Reports that summarize "by month"
        [[[NOAA_month]]]
            encoding = strict_ascii
            template = NOAA/NOAA-%Y-%m.txt.tmpl

    [[SummaryByYear]]
        # Reports that summarize "by year"
        [[[NOAA_year]]]
            encoding = strict_ascii
            template = NOAA/NOAA-%Y.txt.tmpl

    [[ToDate]]
        # Reports that show statistics "to date", such as day-to-date,
        # week-to-date, month-to-date, etc.
        [[[index]]]
            template = index.html.tmpl
        [[[statistics]]]
            template = statistics.html.tmpl
        [[[telemetry]]]
            template = telemetry.html.tmpl
        [[[tabular]]]
            template = tabular.html.tmpl
        [[[celestial]]]
            template = celestial.html.tmpl
            # Uncomment the following to have WeeWX generate a celestial page only once an hour:
            # stale_age = 3600
        [[[RSS]]]
            template = rss.xml.tmpl
    </pre>

        <p>The skin contains three different kinds of generated output:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Summary by Month. The skin uses <span class="code">SummaryByMonth</span> to produce NOAA summaries, one
                for each month, as a simple text file.
            </li>
            <li>Summary by Year. The skin uses <span class="code">SummaryByYear</span> to produce NOAA summaries, one
                for each year, as a simple text file.
            </li>
            <li>Summary "To Date". The skin produces an HTML <span class="code">index.html</span> page, as well as HTML
                files for detailed statistics, telemetry, and celestial information. It also includes a master page
                (<span class="code">tabular.html</span>) in which NOAA information is displayed. All these files are
                HTML.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The encoding for text files is <span class="code">strict_ascii</span>, whereas the encoding for html files
            is <span class="code">html_entities</span>. This was specified by declaring <span class="code">encoding = html_entities</span>
            at the top level of <span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span> then <span class="code">encoding = strict_ascii</span>
            for each text file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than <span class="code">SummaryByMonth</span> and <span class="code">SummaryByYear</span>, the section
            names are arbitrary. <span class="code">ToDate</span> could just as well have been called <span
            class="code">files_to_date</span>, and the sections <span class="code">index</span>, <span class="code">statistics</span>,
            and <span class="code">telemetry</span> could just as well have been called <span class="code">tom</span>,
            <span class="code">dick</span>, and <span class="code">harry</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use <span class="code">SummaryByYear</span> to generate a set of files, one file per year. The name of the

            <strong>Note</strong><br/> This can create a <em>lot</em> of files &mdash; one per day. If you have 3 years

        </p>

        <h2>Tags</h2>

        <p>
            If you look inside a template, you will see it makes heavy use of <em>tags</em>. As the Cheetah generator
            processes the template, it replaces each tag with an appropriate value and, sometimes, a label. This section
            discusses the details of how that happens.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            If there is a tag error during template generation, the error will show up in the log file. Many errors are
            obvious &mdash; Cheetah will display a line number and list the template file in which the error occurred.
            Unfortunately, in other cases, the error message can be very cryptic and not very useful. So make small
            changes and test often. Use the utility <a href="#wee_reports"><span class="code">wee_reports</span></a> to
            speed up the process.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some examples of tags:</p>
        <pre class="tty">$current.outTemp
$month.outTemp.max
$month.outTemp.maxtime</pre>
        <p>
            These code the current outside temperature, the maximum outside temperature for the month, and the time that
            maximum occurred, respectively. So a template file that contains:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Current conditions&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Current temperature = $current.outTemp&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max for the month is $month.outTemp.max, which occurred at $month.outTemp.maxtime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            would be all you need for a very simple HTML page that would display the text (assuming that the unit group
            for temperature is <span class="code">degree_F</span>):
        </p>

        <p class="example_output">
            Current temperature = 51.0°F <br/> Max for the month is 68.8°F, which occurred at 07-Oct-2009 15:15
        </p>

        <p>
            The format that was used to format the temperature (<span class="code">51.0</span>) is specified in section
            <span class="code"><a href="#Units_StringFormats">[Units][[StringFormat]]</a></span>. The unit label <span
            class="code">°F</span> is from section <span class="code"><a
            href="#Units_Labels">[Units][[Labels]]</a></span>, while the time format is from <span class="code"><a
            href="#Units_TimeFormats">[Units][[TimeFormats]]</a></span>.
        </p>

        <p>As we saw above, the tags can be very simple:</p>
        <pre class="tty">## Output max outside temperature using an appropriate format and label:
$month.outTemp.max</pre>
        <p>
            Most of the time, tags will "do the right thing" and are all you will need. However, WeeWX offers extensive
            customization of the generated output for specialized applications such as XML RSS feeds, or rigidly
            formatted reports (such as the NOAA reports). This section specifies the various tag options available.
        </p>

        <p>There are two different versions of the tags, depending on whether the data is "current", or an aggregation
            over time. However, both versions are similar.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Time period <span class="code">$current</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            Time period <span class="code">$current</span> represents a <em>current observation</em>. An example would
            be the current barometric pressure:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$current.barometer</pre>

        <p>
            Formally, WeeWX first looks for the observation type in the record emitted by the <span class="code">NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD</span>
            event. This is generally the data emitted by the station console, augmented by any derived variables (<i>e.g.</i>
            wind chill) that you might have specified. If the observation type cannot be found there, the most recent
            record in the database will be searched.
        </p>
        <p>The most general tag for a "current" observation looks like:</p>
        <pre class="tty">$current($timestamp=<em>some_time</em>, $max_delta=<em>delta_t</em>,$data_binding=<em>binding_name</em>).<em>obstype</em>[.<em>optional_unit_conversion</em>][.<em>optional_formatting</em>]</pre>
        <p>Where:</p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">some_time</span> is a timestamp that you want to display. It is optional, The default is
            to display the value for the current time.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">delta_t</span> is the largest time difference (in seconds) between the time specified and
            a timestamp of a record in the database that will be returned. By default, it is zero, which means there
            must be an exact match with a specified time for a record to be retrieved.
        </p>


        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">binding_name</span> is a <em>binding name</em> to a database. An example would be <span
            class="code">wx_binding</span>. See the section <em><a href="#binding_names">Binding names</a></em> for more
            details.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">obstype</span> is an observation type, such as <span
            class="code">barometer</span>. This type must appear either as a field in the database,
            or in the current (usually, the latest) record.</span>

            Time period <span class="code">$latest</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            Time period <span class="code">$latest</span> is very similar to <span class="code">$current</span>, except
            that it uses the last available timestamp in a database. Usually, <span class="code">$current</span> and
            <span class="code">$latest</span> are the same, but if a data binding points to a remote database, they may
            not be. See the section <em><a href="#stupid_detail">Using multiple bindings</a></em> for an example where
            this happened.
        </p>

        <h3 id="general_aggregation_periods">Aggregation periods</h3>

        <p>Aggregation periods is the other kind of tag. For example,</p>
        <pre class="tty">$week.rain.sum</pre>
        <p>
            represents an <em>aggregation over time</em>, using a certain <em>aggregation type</em>. In this example,
            the aggregation time is a week, and the aggregation type is summation. So, this tag represents the total
            rainfall over a week.
        </p>

        <p>The most general tag for an aggregation over time looks like:</p>
        <pre
            class="tty">$<em>period</em>($data_binding=<em>binding_name</em>, <em>$optional_ago</em>=<em>delta</em>).<em>statstype</em>.<em>aggregation</em>[.<em>optional_unit_conversion</em>][.<em>optional_formatting</em>]</pre>
        <p>Where:</p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">period</span> is the time period over which the aggregation is to be done. Possible
            choices are listed in a table below.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">binding_name</span> is a <em>binding name</em> to a database. An example would be <span
            class="code">wx_binding</span>. See the section <em><a href="#binding_names">Binding names</a></em> for more
            details.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code"><em>optional_ago</em></span> is a keyword that depends on the aggregation period. For
            example, for <span class="code">week</span>, it would be <span class="code">weeks_ago</span>, for <span
            class="code">day</span>, it would be <span class="code">days_ago</span>, <i>etc.</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">delta</span> is an integer indicating which aggregation period is desired. For example
            <span class="code">$week($weeks_ago=1)</span> indicates last week, <span
            class="code">$day($days_ago=2)</span> would be the day-before-yesterday, <i>etc</i>. The default is zero:
            that is, this aggregation period.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">statstype</span> is a <em>statistical type</em>. This is generally any observation type
            that appears in the database, as well as a few synthetic types (such as heating and cooling degree-days).
            Not all aggregations are supported for all types.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            <span class="code">aggregation</span> is an <em>aggregation type</em>. If you ask for <span class="code">$month.outTemp.avg</span>
            you are asking for the <em>average</em> outside temperature for the month. Possible aggregation types are
            given in <em><a href="#aggregation_types">Appendix: Aggregation types</a></em>.

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Note that the same formatting conventions can be used for aggregation periods, such as <span class="code">$month</span>,
            as well as <span class="code">$current</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Start, end, and <span class="code">dateTime</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            While not an observation type, in many ways the time of an observation, <span class="code">dateTime</span>,
            can be treated as one. A tag such as
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$current.dateTime</pre>
        <p>
            represents the <em>current time</em> (more properly, the time as of the end of the last archive interval)
            and would produce something like
        </p>
        <pre class="example_output">01/09/2010 12:30:00</pre>
        <p>
            Like true observation types, explicit formats can be specified, except that they require a <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior"> strftime() <em>time
            format</em> </a>, rather than a <em>string format</em>.
        </p>

        <p>For example, adding a format descriptor like this:</p>
        <pre class="tty">$current.dateTime.format("%d-%b-%Y %H:%M")</pre>
        <p>produces</p>

        <p class="example_output">09-Jan-2010 12:30</p>

        <p>
            For <em>aggregation periods</em>, such as <span class="code">$month</span>, you can request the
            <em>start</em> or <em>end</em> of the period, by using suffixes <span class="code">.start</span> or <span
            class="code">.end</span>, respectively. For example,
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">The current month runs from $month.start to $month.end.</pre>
        <p>results in</p>
        <pre class="example_output">The current month runs from 01/01/2010 12:00:00 AM to 02/01/2017 12:00:00 AM.</pre>

        <p>
            In addition to the suffixes <span class="code">.start</span> and <span class="code">.end</span>, the suffix
            <span class="code">.dateTime</span> is provided for backwards compatibility. Like <span
            class="code">.start</span>, it refers to the start of the interval.
        </p>

        <p>
            The returned string values will always be in <em>local time</em>. However, if you ask for the raw value
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$current.dateTime.raw</pre>

        <p>
            the returned value will be in Unix Epoch Time (number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970,
            <em>i.e.</em>, a large number), which you must convert yourself. It is guaranteed to never be <span
            class="code">None</span>, so you don't worry have to worry about handling a <span class="code">None</span>
            value.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Tag <span class="code">$trend</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            The tag <span class="code">$trend</span> is available for time trends, such as changes in barometric
            pressure. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <table class="indent" style="width: 50%">
            <tbody>
            <tr class="first_row">

                <td class="code">-.02 inHg</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">$trend.outTemp</td>

            <tr>

            <tr>

            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            Note how you can explicitly specify a value in the tag itself (2nd row in the table above). If you do not
            specify a value, then a default time interval, set by option <span class="code"><a
            href="#trend">time_delta</a></span> in the skin configuration file, will be used. This value can be
            retrieved by using the syntax <span class="code">$trend.time_delta</span> (3rd row in the table).
        </p>

        <p>For example, the template expression</p>
        <pre class="tty">The barometer trend over $trend.time_delta.hour is $trend.barometer.format("%+.2f")</pre>
        <p>would result in</p>

        <p class="example_output">The barometer trend over 3 hrs is +.03 inHg.</p>

        <p>
            The tag <span class="code">$span</span> allows aggregation over a user defined period up to and including
            the current time. Its most general form looks like:
        </p>

            <span class="code"><em>$optional_delta</em>=<em>delta</em></span> is one or more comma separated delta
            settings from the table below. If more than one delta setting is included then the period used for the
            aggregate is the sum of the individual delta settings. If no delta setting is included, or all included
            delta settings are zero, the returned aggregate is based on the current <span class="code">obstype</span>

        <h2>Almanac</h2>

        <p>
            If module <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem">pyephem</a> has been installed, then WeeWX can generate
            extensive almanac information for the Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and other heavenly bodies, including
            their rise, transit and set times, as well as their azimuth and altitude. Other information is also
            available.
        </p>

        <p>Here is an example template:</p>

        <pre class="tty">Current time is $current.dateTime
#if $almanac.hasExtras
Sunrise, transit, sunset: $almanac.sun.rise $almanac.sun.transit $almanac.sun.set
Moonrise, transit, moonset: $almanac.moon.rise $almanac.moon.transit $almanac.moon.set
Mars rise, transit, set: $almanac.mars.rise $almanac.mars.transit $almanac.mars.set
Azimuth, altitude of mars: $almanac.mars.az $almanac.mars.alt
Next new, full moon: $almanac.next_new_moon $almanac.next_full_moon
Next summer, winter solstice: $almanac.next_summer_solstice $almanac.next_winter_solstice
#else
Sunrise, sunset: $almanac.sunrise $almanac.sunset
#end if</pre>

        <p>If pyephem is installed this would result in:</p>

        <p class="example_output">
            Current time is 29-Mar-2011 09:20<br/> Sunrise, transit, sunset: 06:51 13:11 19:30<br/> Moonrise, transit,
            moonset: 04:33 09:44 15:04<br/> Mars rise, transit, set: 06:35 12:30 18:26<br/> Azimuth, altitude of mars:
            124.354959275 26.4808431952<br/> Next new, full moon: 03-Apr-2011 07:32 17-Apr-2011 19:43<br/> Next summer,
            winter solstice: 21-Jun-2011 10:16 21-Dec-2011 21:29
        </p>

        <p>Otherwise, a fallback of basic calculations is used, resulting in:</p>

        <p class="example_output">
            Current time is 29-Mar-2011 09:20<br/> Sunrise, sunset: 06:51 19:30
        </p>

        <p>
            As shown in the example, you can test whether this extended almanac information is available with the value
            <span class="code">$almanac.hasExtras</span>.
        </p>

        <p>The almanac information falls into three categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calendar events</li>
            <li>Heavenly bodies</li>
            <li>Functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will cover each of these separately.</p>
        <h3>Calendar events</h3>

        <p>
            "Calendar events" do not require a heavenly body. They cover things such as <span
            class="code">next_solstice</span>, <span class="code">next_first_quarter_moon</span> or <span class="code">sidereal_time</span>.
            The syntax here is:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac.next_solstice</pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac.next_first_quarter_moon</pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac.sidereal_time</pre>
        <p>Here is a table of the information that falls into this category:</p>
        <table class="indent" style="width: 60%">
            <caption>Calendar events</caption>
            <tbody class="code">

                <td>previous_equinox</td>
                <td>next_equinox</td>
                <td>previous_solstice</td>
                <td>next_solstice</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>previous_autumnal_equinox</td>
                <td>next_autumnal_equinox</td>

            <tr>
                <td>previous_new_moon</td>
                <td>next_new_moon</td>
                <td>previous_first_quarter_moon</td>
                <td>next_first_quarter_moon</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>previous_full_moon</td>
                <td>next_full_moon</td>
                <td>previous_last_quarter_moon</td>

                <td></td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p class="note" style="display: inline-block">
            <strong>Note</strong><br/>The tag <span class="code">$almanac.sidereal_time</span> returns a value in
            decimal degrees rather than a customary value from 0 to 24 hours.
        </p>

        <h3>Heavenly bodies</h3>

        <p>The second category does require a heavenly body. This covers queries such as, "When does Jupiter rise?" or,
            "When does the sun transit?" Examples are
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac.jupiter.rise</pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac.sun.transit</pre>
        <p>
            To accurately calculate these times, WeeWX automatically uses the present temperature and pressure to
            calculate refraction effects. However, you can override these values, which will be necessary if you wish to
            match the almanac times published by the Naval Observatory <a
            href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/rise-set.html">as explained in the pyephem documentation</a>. For
            example, to match the sunrise time as published by the Observatory, instead of
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac.sun.rise</pre>
        <p>use</p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=0, horizon=-34.0/60.0).sun.rise</pre>
        <p>By setting pressure to zero we are bypassing the refraction calculations and manually setting the horizon to
            be 34 arcminutes lower than the normal horizon. This is what the Navy uses.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you wish to calculate the start of civil twilight, you can set the horizon to -6 degrees, and also tell
            WeeWX to use the center of the sun (instead of the upper limb, which it normally uses) to do the calcuation:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=0, horizon=-6).sun(use_center=1).rise</pre>
        <p>The general syntax is:</p>
        <pre class="tty">$almanac(almanac_time=<em>time</em>,            ## Unix epoch time
         lat=<em>latitude</em>, lon=<em>longitude</em>,  ## degrees
         altitude=<em>altitude</em>,            ## meters
         pressure=<em>pressure</em>,            ## mbars
         horizon=<em>horizon</em>,              ## degrees
         temperature=<em>temperature_C</em>     ## degrees C
       ).<em>heavenly_body</em>(use_center=[01]).<em>attribute</em>
      </pre>
        <p>
            As you can see, many other properties can be overridden besides pressure and the horizon angle.
        </p>

        <p>
            PyEphem offers an extensive list of objects that can be used for the <span

        <p>There is actually one one function in this category: <span class="code">separation</span>. It returns the
            angular separation between two heavenly bodies. For example, to calculate the angular separation between
            Venus and Mars you would use:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
&lt;p&gt;The separation between Venus and Mars is
      $almanac.separation(($almanac.venus.alt,$almanac.venus.az), ($almanac.mars.alt,$almanac.mars.az))&lt;/p&gt;

        <h3>Adding new bodies to the almanac</h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to extend the WeeWX almanac, adding new bodies that it was not previously aware of. For
            example, say we wanted to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros"><em>433 Eros</em></a>, the
            first asteroid visited by a spacecraft. Here is the process:
        </p>
        <ol>

            <li>
                Put the following in the file <span class="code">user/extensions.py</span>:
                <pre class="tty">import ephem

                This does two things: it adds orbital information about <em>433 Eros</em> to the internal pyephem
                database, and it makes that data available under the name <span class="code">Eros</span> (note the
                capital letter).
            </li>

            <li>
                You can then use <em>433 Eros</em> like any other body in your templates. For example, to display when
                it will rise above the horizon:

                <pre class="tty">$almanac.eros.rise</pre>

            Wind deserves a few comments because it is stored in the database in two different ways: as a set of
            scalars, and as a <em>vector</em> of speed and direction. Here are the four wind-related scalars stored in
            the main archive database:

        <h2 id="defining_new_tags">Defining new tags</h2>

        <p>
            We have seen how you can change a template and make use of the various tags available such as <span
            class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span> for the maximum outside temperature for the day. But, what if you want
            to introduce some new data for which no tag is available?
        </p>

        <p>
            If you wish to introduce a static tag, that is, one that will not change with time (such as a Google
            analytics Tracker ID, or your name), then this is very easy: simply put it in section <span class="code"><a
            href="#Extras">[Extras]</a></span> in the skin configuration file. More information on how to do this can be
            found there.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, what if you wish to introduce a more dynamic tag, one that requires some calculation, or perhaps uses
            the database? Simply putting it in the <span class="code">[Extras]</span> section won't do, because then it
            cannot change.
        </p>

        <p>
            The answer is to write a <em>search list extension</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>How the search list works</h3>

        <p>
            Let's start by taking a look at how the Cheetah <em>search list</em> works.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Cheetah template engine finds tags by scanning a search list, a Python list of objects. For example, for
            a tag <span class="code">$foo</span>, the engine will scan down the list, trying each object in the list in
            turn. For each object, it will first try using <span class="code">foo</span> as an attribute, that is, it
            will try evaluating <span class="code"><em>obj</em>.foo</span>. If that raises an <span class="code">AttributeError</span>
            exception, then it will try <span class="code">foo</span> as a key, that is <span class="code"><em>obj</em>[key]</span>.
            If that raises a <span class="code">KeyError</span> exception, then it moves on to the next item in the
            list. The first match that does not raise an exception is used. If no match is found, Cheetah raises a <span
            class="code">NameMapper.NotFound</span> exception.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how_tags_work">How tags work</h3>

        <p>
            Now let's take a look at how the search list interacts with WeeWX tags. Let's start by looking at a simple
            example: station altitude, available as the tag
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
$station.altitude</pre>

        <p>
            As we saw in the previous section, Cheetah will run down the search list, looking for an object with a key
            or attribute <span class="code">station</span>. In the default search list, WeeWX includes one such object,
            an instance of the class <span class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.Station</span>, which has an attribute
            <span class="code">station</span>, so it gets a hit on this object.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cheetah will then try to evaluate the attribute <span class="code">altitude</span> on this object. Class
            <span class="code">Station</span> has such an attribute, so Cheetah evaluates it.
        </p>

        <p>
            What this attribute returns is not a raw value, say <span class="code">700</span>, nor even a string.
            Instead, it returns an instance of the class <span class="code">ValueHelper</span>, a special class defined
            in module <span class="code">weewx.units</span>. Internally, it holds not only the raw value, but also
            references to the formats, labels, and conversion targets you specified in your configuration file. Its job
            is to make sure that the final output reflects these preferences. Cheetah doesn't know anything about this
            class. What it needs, when it has finished evaluating the expression <span
            class="code">$station.altitude</span>, is a <em>string</em>. In order to convert the <span class="code">ValueHelper</span>
            it has in hand into a string, it does what every other Python object does when faced with this problem: it
            calls the special method <span class="code"><a style="text-decoration: none"
                                                           href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__">__str__</a></span>.
            Class <span class="code">ValueHelper</span> has a definition for this method. Evaluating this function
            triggers the final steps in this process. Any necessary unit conversions are done, then formatting occurs
            and, finally, a label is attached. The result is a string something like
        </p>

        <p class="example_output">700 feet</p>

        <p>
            which is what Cheetah actually puts in the generated HTML file. This is a good example of <em>lazy
            evaluation</em>. The tags gather all the information they need, but don't do the final evaluation until the
            last final moment, when the most context is understood. WeeWX uses this technique extensively.
        </p>

        <p>Now let's look at a more complicated example, say the maximum temperature since midnight:</p>
        <pre class="tty">$day.outTemp.max</pre>
        <p>
            When this is evaluated by Cheetah, it actually produces a chain of objects. At the top of this chain is
            class <span class="code">weewx.tags.TimeBinder</span>, an instance of which is included in the default
            search list. Internally, this instance stores the time of the desired report (usually the time of the last
            archive record), a cache to the databases, a default data binding, as well as references to the formatting
            and labelling options you have chosen.
        </p>

        <p>
            This instance is examined by Cheetah to see if it has an attribute <span class="code">day</span>. It does
            and, when it is evaluated, it returns the next class in the chain, an instance of <span class="code">weewx.tags.TimespanBinder</span>.
            In addition to all the other things contained in its parent <span class="code">TimeBinder</span>, class
            <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span> adds the desired time period, that is, the time span from midnight
            to the current time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cheetah then continues on down the chain and tries to find the next attribute, <span
            class="code">outTemp</span>. There is no such hard coded attribute (hard coding all the conceivable
            different observation types would be impossible!). Instead, class <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span>
            defines the Python special method <span class="code"> <a style="text-decoration: none"
                                                                     href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__">__getattr__</a></span>.
            If Python cannot find a hard coded version of an attribute, and the method <span
            class="code">__getattr__</span> exists, it will try it. The definition provided by <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span>
            returns an instance of the next class in the chain, <span class="code">weewx.tags.ObservationBinder</span>,
            which not only remembers all the previous stuff, but also adds the observation type, <span class="code">outTemp</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cheetah then tries to evaluate an attribute <span class="code">max</span> of this class. Now, finally, the
            chain ends. The attribute <span class="code">max</span> triggers the actual calculation of the value, using
            all the known parameters: the database binding to be hit, the time span of interest, the observation type,
            and the type of aggregation, querying the database as necessary. The database is not actually hit until the
            last possible moment, after everything needed to do the evalation is known.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like our previous example, the results of the evaluation are then packaged up in an instance of <span
            class="code">ValueHelper</span>, which does the final conversion to the desired units, formats the string,
            then adds a label. The results, something like
        </p>

        <p class="example_output">12&deg;C</p>

        <p>
            are put in the generated HTML file. As you can see, a lot of machinery is hidden behind the deceptively
            simple expression <span class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span>!
        </p>

        <h3 id="extending_the_list">Extending the list</h3>

        <p>
            As mentioned, WeeWX comes with a number of objects already in the search list, but you can extend it. To do
            so, you should have some familiarity with Python, in particular, how to write new classes and member
            functions for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's look at an example. The regular version of WeeWX offers statistical summaries by day, week, month, and
            year. Suppose we would like to add two more:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All-time statistics. This would allow us to display statistics such as the all-time high or low
                temperature seen at your station;
            </li>
            <li>Seven days statistics. While WeeWX offers the tag <span class="code">$week</span>, this is statistics
                <em>since Sunday at midnight</em>. We would like to have statistics for a full week, that is since
                midnight seven days ago.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This example is included in the distribution as <span class="code">examples/stats.py</span>. If you wish to
            use or modify it, first copy it over to <span class="code">user/stats.py</span> then modify it there.

        # Convert it to unix epoch time:
        week_ts = time.mktime(week_dt.timetuple())                           # 6
        # Form a TimespanBinder object, using the time span we just
        # calculated:
        seven_day_stats = TimespanBinder(TimeSpan(week_ts, timespan.stop),
                                         db_lookup,
                                         formatter=self.generator.formatter,
                                         converter=self.generator.converter,
                                         skin_dict=self.generator.skin_dict) # 7

        # Now create a small dictionary with keys 'alltime' and 'seven_day':
        search_list_extension = {'alltime'   : all_stats,
                                 'seven_day' : seven_day_stats}              # 8

        # Finally, return our extension as a list:
        return [search_list_extension]                                       # 9</pre>

        <p>Going through the example, line by line:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new class called <span class="code">MyStats</span>, which will inherit from class <span
                class="code">SearchList</span>. All search list extensions inherit from this class.
            </li>
            <li>Create an initializer for our new class. In this case, the initializer is not really necessary and does
                nothing except pass its only parameter, <span class="code">generator</span>, a reference to the calling
                generator, on to its superclass, <span class="code">SearchList</span>. The superclass will store it in
                <span class="code">self</span>.
            </li>
            <li>Override member function <span class="code">get_extension_list()</span>. This function will be called
                when the generator is ready to accept your new search list extension. The parameters that will be passed
                in are:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">self</span> Python's way of indicating the instance we are working with;
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="code">timespan</span> An instance of the utility class <span
                        class="code">TimeSpan</span>. This will contain the valid start and ending times used by the
                        template. Normally, this is all valid times;
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="code">db_lookup</span> This is a function supplied by the generator. It takes a
                        single argument, a name of a binding. When called, it will return an instance of the database
                        manager class for that binding. The default for the function is whatever binding you set with
                        the option <span class="code">data_binding</span> for this report, usually <span class="code">wx_binding</span>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The class <span class="code">TimespanBinding</span> represents a statistical calculation over a time
                period. We have already met it in the introduction <em><a href="#how_tags_work">How tags work</a></em>.
                In our case, we will set it up to represent the statistics over all possible times. The class takes 5
                parameters.
                <ul>
                    <li>The first, <span class='code'>timespan</span>, is the timespan over which the calculation is to
                        be done. Here, we have a lucky coincidence: the variable <span class="code">timespan</span>
                        already holds a <span class="code">TimeSpan</span> object representing the domain of all valid
                        timespans, so we simply pass it in.
                    </li>
                    <li>The second, <span class='code'>db_lookup</span>, is the database lookup function to be used. We
                        simply pass in <span class="code">db_lookup</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The third, <span class="code">formatter</span>, should be an instance of class <span
                        class="code">weewx.units.Formatter</span>, which contains information about how the results
                        should be formatted. We just pass in the formatter set up by the generator, <span class="code">self.generator.formatter</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The fourth, <span class="code">converter</span>, should be an instance of <span class="code">weewx.units.Converter</span>,
                        which contains information about the target units (<i>e.g.</i>, <span
                            class="code">degree_C</span>) that are to be used. Again, we just pass in the instance set
                        up by the generator, <span class="code">self.generator.converter</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The fifth, <span class="code">skin_dict</span>, is an instance of <span class="code">configobj.ConfigObj</span>,
                        and contains the contents of the skin configuration file. We pass it on in order to allow
                        aggregations that need information from the file, such as heating and cooling degree-days.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            That one was relatively easy because we already had an instance of <span class="code">TimeSpan</span>, that
            is, <span class="code">timespan</span>, which represented the time over which we wanted to do the
            calculations. Setting up an instance that will work for the last seven days is a bit trickier. Continuing
            our example...
        </p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>The object <span class="code">timespan</span> holds the domain of all valid times, but in order to
                calculate statistics for the last seven days, we need not the earliest valid time, but the time at
                midnight seven days ago. So, we do a little Python date arithmetic to calculate this. The object <span
                    class="code">week_dt</span> will be an instance of <span class="code">datetime.date</span>.
            </li>
            <li>We convert it to unix epoch time.</li>
            <li>Now we are ready to initialize an appropriate <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span> object. It's the
                same as in step #4, except we use our new timespan object.
            </li>
            <li>Create a small dictionary with two keys, <span class="code">alltime</span>, and <span class="code">seven_day</span>.
            </li>
            <li>Return the dictionary in a list</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The final step that we need to do is to tell the template engine where to find our extension. You do that by
            going into the skin configuration file, <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, and adding the option <span
            class="code">search_list_extensions</span> with our new extension. When you're done, it will look something
            like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]
    # This section is used by the generator CheetahGenerator, and specifies
    # which files are to be generated from which template.

    # Possible encodings are 'html_entities', 'utf8', or 'strict_ascii'
    encoding = html_entities
    <span class="highlight">search_list_extensions = user.stats.MyStats</span>

    [[SummaryByMonth]]
    ...
</pre>
        <p>
            Our addition has been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>. Note that it is in the section <span
            class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, if the Cheetah engine encounters the tag <span class="code">
          $alltime</span>, it will scan the search list, looking for an attribute or key that matches <span
            class="code">alltime</span>. When it gets to the little dictionary we provided, it will find a matching key,
            allowing it to retrieve the appropriate <span class="code">TimespanBinding</span> object.
        </p>

        <p>With this approach, you can now include "all time" or "seven day" statistics in your HTML templates:</p>
        <pre class="tty">
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Maximum temperature to date: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$alltime.outTemp.max&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Minimum temperature to date: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$alltime.outTemp.min
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Rain over the last seven days: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$seven_day.rain.sum
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            We put our addition in the file <span class="code">user/stats.py</span>, which means it will be in the
            directory hierarchy where <span class="code">weewxd</span> resides. Python will search this hierarchy by
            default, so it will find our addition. However, if you put it somewhere else, may will have to specify its
            location with the environment variable <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH"><span
            class="code">PYTHONPATH</span></a> when you start WeeWX:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">export PYTHONPATH=/home/me/secret_location</pre>


        <h1 id="image_generator">The Image generator</h1>

        <p class="note">
            This section gives an overview of the Image generator. For details about each of its various options, see
            the section <a href="#ImageGenerator"><em>[ImageGenerator]</em></a> in the <a href="#report_options"><em>Reference:
            report options</em></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The installed version of WeeWX is configured to generate a set of useful plots. But, what if you don't like
            how they look, or you want to generate different plots, perhaps with different aggregation types? This
            section covers how to do this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Image generation is controlled by the section <a href="#ImageGenerator"><span
            class="code">[ImageGenerator]</span></a> in the skin configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
            Let's take a look at the beginning part of this section. It looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[ImageGenerator]
    ...
    image_width = 500
    image_height = 180
    image_background_color = #f5f5f5

    chart_background_color = #d8d8d8
    chart_gridline_color = #a0a0a0
    ...</pre>
        <p>
            The options right under the section name <span class="code">[ImageGenerator]</span> will apply to
            <em>all</em> plots, unless overridden in subsections. So, unless otherwise changed, all plots will be 500
            pixels in width, 180 pixels in height, and will have an RGB background color of #f5f5f5, a very light gray
            (HTML color "WhiteSmoke"). The chart itself will have a background color of #d8d8d8 (a little darker gray),
            and the gridlines will be #a0a0a0 (still darker). The other options farther down (not shown) will also apply
            to all plots.
        </p>

        <h2>Time periods</h2>

        <p>
            After the "global" options at the top of section <span class="code">[ImageGenerator]</span>, comes a set of
            sub-sections, one for each time period (day, week, month, and year). These sub-sections define the nature of
            aggregation and plot types for that time period. For example, here is a typical set of options for
            sub-section <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span>. It controls which "monthly" images will get
            generated, and what they will look like:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">    [[month_images]]
        x_label_format = %d
        bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M
        time_length = 2592000    # == 30 days
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 10800    # == 3 hours
        show_daynight = false
</pre>
        <p>
            The option <span class="code">x_label_format</span> gives a <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior">strftime()</a> type format
            for the x-axis. In this example, it will only show days (format option <span class="code">%d</span>). The
            <span class="code">bottom_label_format</span> is the format used to time stamp the image at the bottom. In
            this example, it will show the time as something like <span class="code">10/25/09
          15:35</span>. A plot will cover a nominal 30 days, and all items included in it will use an aggregate type of
            averaging over 3 hours. Finally, by setting option <span class="code">show_daynight</span> to <span
            class="code">false</span>, we are requesting that day-night, shaded bands not be shown.
        </p>

        <h2>Image files</h2>

        <p>
            Within each time period sub-section is another nesting, one for each image to be generated. The title of
            each sub-sub-section is the filename to be used for the image. Finally, at one additional nesting level (!)
            are the logical names of all the line types to be drawn in the image. Like elsewhere, the values specified
            in the level above can be overridden. For example, here is a typical set of options for sub-sub-section
            <span class="code">[[[monthrain]]]</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">        [[[monthrain]]]
            plot_type = bar
            yscale = None, None, 0.02
            [[[[rain]]]]
                aggregate_type = sum
                aggregate_interval = 86400
                label = Rain (daily total)</pre>
        <p>
            This will generate an image file with name <span class="code">monthrain.png</span>. It will be a bar plot.
            Option <span class="code">yscale</span> controls the y-axis scaling &mdash; if left out, the scale will
            automatically be chosen. However, in this example we are choosing to exercise some degree of control by
            specifying values explicitly. The option is a 3-way tuple (<span class="code">ylow</span>, <span
            class="code">yhigh</span>, <span class="code">min_interval</span>), where <span class="code">ylow</span> and
            <span class="code">yhigh</span> are the minimum and maximum y-axis values, respectively, and <span
            class="code">min_interval</span> is the minimum tick interval. If set to <span class="code">None</span>, the
            corresponding value will be automatically chosen. So, in this example, the setting
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">yscale = None, None, 0.02</pre>
        <p>
            will cause WeeWX to pick sensible y minimum and maximum values, but require that the tick increment (<span
            class="code">min_interval</span>) be at least 0.02.
        </p>

        <p>
            Continuing on with the example above, there will be only one plot "line" (it will actually be a series of
            bars) and it will have logical name <span class="code">rain</span>. Because we have not said otherwise, the
            database column name to be used for this line will be the same as its logical name, that is, <span
            class="code">rain</span>, but this can be overridden. The aggregation type will be summing (overriding the
            averaging specified in sub-section <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span>), so you get the total rain
            over the aggregate period (rather than the average) over an aggregation interval of 86,400 seconds (one
            day). The plot line will be titled with the indicated label of 'Rain (daily total)'. The result of all this
            is the following plot:
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/sample_monthrain.png" alt="Sample monthly rain plot"/>
        </p>

        <h2>Including more than one type in a plot</h2>

        <p>More than one observation can be included in a plot. For example, here is how to generate a plot with the
            week's outside temperature as well as dewpoint:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[monthtempdew]]]
    [[[[outTemp]]]]
    [[[[dewpoint]]]]</pre>
        <p>
            This would create an image in file <span class="code">monthtempdew.png</span> that includes a line plot of
            both outside temperature and dewpoint:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/sample_monthtempdew.png" alt="Monthly temperature and dewpoint"/>
        </p>

        <h2 id="including_same_sql_type_2x">Including a type more than once in a plot</h2>

        <p>
            Another example. Say you want a plot of the day's temperature, overlaid with hourly averages. Here, you are
            using the same data type (<span class="code">outTemp</span>) for both plot lines, the first with averages,
            the second without. If you do the obvious it won't work:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">## WRONG ##
[[[daytemp_with_avg]]]
    [[[[outTemp]]]]
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 3600
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red">[[[[outTemp]]]]</span>  # OOPS! The same section name appears more than once!</pre>
        <p>
            The option parser does not allow the same section name (<span class="code">outTemp</span> in this case) to
            appear more than once at a given level in the configuration file, so an error will be declared (technical
            reason: formally, the sections are an unordered dictionary). If you wish for the same observation to appear
            more than once in a plot then there is a trick you must know: use option <span class="code">data_type</span>.
            This will override the default action that the logical line name is used for the database column. So, our
            example would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[daytemp_with_avg]]]
    [[[[avgTemp]]]]
        data_type = outTemp
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 3600
        label = Avg. Temp.
    [[[[outTemp]]]]</pre>
        <p>
            Here, the first plot line has been given the name <span class="code">avgTemp</span> to distinguish it from
            the second line <span class="code">outTemp</span>. Any name will do &mdash; it just has to be different. We
            have specified that the first line will use data type <span class="code"> outTemp</span> and that it will
            use averaging over a one hour period. The second also uses <span class="code">outTemp</span>, but will not
            use averaging.
        </p>

        <p>The result is a nice plot of the day's temperature, overlaid with a one hour smoothed average:</p>

        <p>
            <img alt="Daytime temperature with running average" src="images/daytemp_with_avg.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>One more example. This one shows daily high and low temperatures for a year:</p>
        <pre class="tty">[[year_images]]
    [[[yearhilow]]]
        [[[[hi]]]]
            data_type = outTemp

        <h2>Progressive vector plots</h2>

        <p>
            WeeWX can produce progressive vector plots as well as the more conventional x-y plots. To produce these, use
            plot type <span class="code">vector</span>. You need a vector type to produce this kind of plot. There are
            two: <span class="code">windvec</span>, and <span class="code">windgustvec</span>. While they do not
            actually appear in the database, WeeWX understands that they represent special vector-types. The first,
            <span class="code">windvec</span>, represents the average wind in an archive period, the second, <span
            class="code">windgustvec</span> the max wind in an archive period. Here's how to produce a progressive
            vector for one week that shows the hourly biggest wind gusts, along with hourly averages:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[weekgustoverlay]]]
    aggregate_interval = 3600
    [[[[windvec]]]]
        label = Hourly Wind
        plot_type = vector
        aggregate_type = avg
    [[[[windgustvec]]]]
        label = Gust Wind
        plot_type = vector
        aggregate_type = max</pre>
        <p>
            This will produce an image file with name <span class="code">weekgustoverlay.png</span>. It will consist of
            two progressive vector plots, both using hourly aggregation (3,600 seconds). For the first set of vectors,
            the hourly average will be used. In the second, the max of the gusts will be used:
        </p>

        <p>
            <img alt="hourly average wind vector overlaid with gust vectors" src="images/weekgustoverlay.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            By default, the sticks in the progressive wind plots point towards the wind source. That is, the stick for a
            wind from the west will point left. If you have a chronic wind direction (as I do), you may want to rotate
            the default direction so that all the vectors do not line up over the x-axis, overlaying each other. Do this
            by using option <span class="code">vector_rotate</span>. For example, with my chronic westerlies, I set
            <span class="code">vector_rotate</span> to 90.0 for the plot above, so winds out of the west point straight
            up.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you use this kind of plot (the out-of-the-box version of WeeWX includes daily, weekly, monthly, and
            yearly progressive wind plots), a small compass rose will be put in the lower-left corner of the image to
            show the orientation of North.
        </p>

        <h2>Overriding values</h2>

        <p>
            Remember that values at any level can override values specified at a higher level. For example, say you want
            to generate the standard plots, but for a few key observation types such as barometer, you want to also
            generate some oversized plots to give you extra detail, perhaps for an HTML popup. The standard <span
            class="code">weewx.conf</span> file specifies plot size of 300x180 pixels, which will be used for all plots
            unless overridden:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[ImageGenerator]
    ...
    image_width = 300
    image_height = 180</pre>
        <p>
            The standard plot of barometric pressure will appear in <span class="code">daybarometer.png</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[daybarometer]]]
    [[[[barometer]]]] </pre>
        <p>
            We now add our special plot of barometric pressure, but specify a larger image size. This image will be put
            in file <span class="code">daybarometer_big.png</span>.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[daybarometer_big]]]
    image_width  = 600
    image_height = 360
    [[[[barometer]]]]</pre>


        <h1 id="Using_multiple_bindings">Using multiple bindings</h1>

        <p>
            It's easy to use more than one database in your reports. Here's an example. In my office I have two
            consoles: a VantagePro2 connected to a Dell Optiplex, and a WMR100N, connected to a Raspberry Pi. Each is
            running WeeWX. The Dell is using SQLite, the RPi, MySQL.
        </p>

        <p>Suppose I wish to compare the inside temperatures of the two consoles. How would I do that?</p>

        <p>
            It's easier to access MySQL across a network than SQLite, so let's run the reports on the Dell, but access
            the RPi's MySQL database remotely. Here's how the bindings and database sections of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            would look on the Dell:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[DataBindings]
    # This section binds a data store to an actual database

    [[wx_binding]]
        # The database to be used - it should match one of the sections in [Databases]
        database = archive_sqlite
        # The name of the table within the database
        table_name = archive
        # The class to manage the database
        manager = weewx.wxmanager.DaySummaryManager
        # The schema defines to structure of the database contents
        schema = schemas.wview_extended.schema

<span class="highlight">    [[wmr100_binding]]
        # Binding for my WMR100 on the RPi
        database = rpi_mysql
        # The name of the table within the database
        table_name = archive
        # The class to manage the database
        manager = weewx.wxmanager.DaySummaryManager
        # The schema defines to structure of the database contents
        schema = schemas.wview_extended.schema</span>

[Databases]
    # This section binds to the actual database to be used

    [[archive_sqlite]]
        database_type = SQLite
        database_name = weewx.sdb

<span class="highlight">    [[rpi_mysql]]
        database_type = MySQL
        database_name = weewx
        host = rpi-bug</span>

[DatabaseTypes]
    #   This section defines defaults for the different types of databases.

    [[SQLite]]
        driver = weedb.sqlite
        # Directory in which the database files are located
        SQLITE_ROOT = %(WEEWX_ROOT)s/archive

    [[MySQL]]
        driver = weedb.mysql
        # The host where the database is located
        host = localhost
        # The user name for logging in to the host
        user = weewx
        # The password for the user name
        password = weewx
    </pre>

        <p>
            The two additions have been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>. The first, <span class="code">[[wmr100_binding]]</span>,
            adds a new binding called <span class="code">wmr10_binding</span>. It links ("binds") to the new database,
            called <span class="code">rpi_mysql</span>, through the option <span class="code">database</span>. It also
            defines some characteristics of the binding, such as which manager is to be used and what its schema looks
            like.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second addition, <span class="code">[[rpi-mysql]]</span> defines the new database. Option <span
            class="code">database_type</span> is set to <span class="code">MySQL</span>, indicating that it is a MySQL
            database. Defaults for MySQL databases are defined in the section <span class="code">[[MySQL]]</span>. The
            new database accepts all of them, except for <span class="code">host</span>, which as been set to the remote
            host <span class="code">rpi-bug</span>, the name of my Raspberry Pi.
        </p>

        <h2>Explicit binding in tags</h2>

        <p>How do we use this new binding? First, let's do a text comparison, using tags. Here's what our template looks
            like:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_label"&gt;Inside Temperature, Vantage&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_data"&gt;$current.inTemp&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_label"&gt;Inside Temperature, WMR100&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_data"&gt;$latest<span class="highlight">($data_binding='wmr100_binding')</span>.inTemp&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>

        <p>
            The explicit binding to <span class="code">wmr100_binding</span> is highlighted. This tells the reporting
            engine to override the default binding specifed in <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>, generally <span
            class="code">wx_binding</span>, and use <span class="code">wmr100_binding</span> instead.
        </p>

        <p>This results in an HTML output that looks like:</p>

        <div id="stats_group" class="indent">
            <div class="stats example_output">
                <table>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="stats_label">Inside Temperature, Vantage</td>
                        <td class="stats_data">68.7&#176;F</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="stats_label">Inside Temperature, WMR100</td>
                        <td class="stats_data">68.9&#176;F</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Explicit binding in images</h2>

        <p>
            How would we produce a graph of the two different temperatures? Here's what the relevant section of the
            <span class="code">skin.conf</span> file would look like.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[daycompare]]]
   [[[[inTemp]]]]
       label = Vantage inTemp
   [[[[WMR100Temp]]]]
       data_type = inTemp
       data_binding = wmr100_binding
       label = WMR100 inTemp</pre>

        <p>
            This will produce an image with name <span class="code">daycompare.png</span>, with two plot lines. The
            first will be of the temperature from the Vantage. It uses the default binding, <span class="code">wx_binding</span>,
            and will be labeled <span class="code">Vantage inTemp</span>. The second explicitly uses the <span
            class="code">wmr100_binding</span>. Because it uses the same variable name (<span class="code">inTemp</span>)
            as the first line, we had to explicitly specify it using option <span class="code">data_type</span>, in
            order to avoid using the same sub-section name twice (see the section <em><a
            href="#including_same_sql_type_2x">Including a type more than once in a plot</a></em> for details). It will
            be labeled <span class="code">WMR100 inTemp</span>. The results look like this:
        </p>
        <img src='images/daycompare.png' alt="Comparing temperatures"/>

        <h2 id="stupid_detail">Stupid detail</h2>

        <p>
            At first, I could not get this example to work. The problem turned out to be that the RPi was processing
            things just a beat behind the Dell, so the temperature for the "current" time wasn't ready when the Dell
            needed it. I kept getting <span class="code">N/A</span>. To avoid this, I introduced the tag <span
            class="code">$latest</span>, which uses the last available timestamp in the binding, which may or may not be
            the same as what <span class="code">$current</span> uses. That's why the example above uses <span
            class="code">$latest</span> instead of <span class="code">$current</span>.
        </p>


        <h1 id="localization">Localization</h1>

        <p>
            This section is provides suggestions for localization, including translation to different languages and
            display of data in formats specific to a locale.
        </p>

        <h2>How to localize a single report</h2>

        <p>
            What happens when you come accross a report that you like, but it is written in another language, or uses
            time formats that are foreign to your customs? This section explains how to convert the report to local
            formats and language.
        </p>

        <h3>Translate the templates</h3>

        <p>
            Translate the text in each template file to the target language. Any strings that are not specified using
            tags will need to be translated.
        </p>
        <p>
            In every HTML template (these typically have a file suffix of <span class="code">.html.tmpl</span>) change
            the HTML "lang" attribute to the target language. For example, for Spanish use <span class="code">es</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="<span class="highlight">es</span>"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    ...
</pre>
        <p>
            The <span class="code">lang</span> can be language-only, e.g., <span class="code">en</span>, or it can be a
            full language-country code, e.g., <span class="code">en-US</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">language codes</a><br/> <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp">country codes</a><br/>
        </p>

        <h3>Translate labels and modify local options</h3>

        <p>
            Go through the report options that are used by the skin, translating labels and modifying formats to follow
            local conventions. You can easily localize all of your reports by doing this in the section <span
            class="code">[StdReport] / [[Defaults]]</span> in the WeeWX configuration file <span
            class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default time formats should use whatever locale is defined on the computer running WeeWX. For example,
            the format for current time, <span class="code">current = %x %X</span>, results in <span class="code">01/13/19 10:01:01</span>
            when the locale is United States english (<span class="code">en_US</span>), but results in <span
            class="code">13.01.2019 10:01:01</span> when the locale is German (<span class="code">de_DE</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
            First try the generic date (<span class="code">%x</span>), time (<span class="code">%X</span>), and day
            (<span class="code">%A</span>) formats &mdash; these will use the locale of your computer. If you still find
            those foreign, you can customize using the <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior">specific
            directives</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a list of the options in <span class="code">[StdReport] / [[Defaults]]</span>, with the options you

        <h2>How to create a skin for multiple locales</h2>

        <p>
            Let's say that you have created a new skin. How do you package that skin for use in other languages and
            locales? This example shows how to translate the <em>Seasons</em> skin for multiple languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a directory for each language. Each directory contains template files and a skin configuration file.
            Any text in each template file should be in the target language. Ensure that each HTML template file has the
            <span class="code">lang</span> set properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Translate observation names and other labels, and put them into the skin configuration files. There should
            be one configuration file for each language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ensure that any locale-specific formatting is specified properly. For example, consider the <span
            class="code">current</span> time, which is parameterized in <span class="code">[Units][[TimeFormats]]</span>.
            Users in a locale that uses 24-hour time expect the format <span class="code">%H:%M</span> whereas users in
            a locale that uses 12-hour time expect <span class="code">%I:%M %p</span>. To make each translation
            independent of the computer on which the reports will be generated, you must use the specific localization;
            if you specify the generic format <span class="code">%X</span>, that will result in the format used by
            whatever locale is set in the environment in which WeeWX is running.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result will be a directory of templates and configurations, with one directory for each
            language/localization.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
skins/Seasons/

skins/Seasons/es/index.html.tmpl
skins/Seasons/de/skin.conf
skins/Seasons/de/index.html.tmpl
skins/Seasons/fr/skin.conf
skins/Seasons/fr/index.html.tmpl</pre>

        <p>
            Users will then create each report in the WeeWX configuration file.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">

    [[Seasons_en]]

        skin = Seasons/de
        HTML_ROOT = public_html/de
    [[Seasons_fr]]
        skin = Seasons/fr
        HTML_ROOT = public_html/fr</pre>
        <p>
            The result is multiple reports, each in a different language and localization, independent of the locale of
            the computer on which they were generated.

        <h1 id="service_engine">Customizing the WeeWX service engine </h1>

        <p>This is an advanced topic intended for those who wish to try their hand at extending the internal engine in
            WeeWX. Before attempting these examples, you should be reasonably proficient with Python.
        </p>

        <p class="warning">Please note that the API to the service engine may change in future versions!</p>

        <p>
            At a high level, WeeWX consists of an <em>engine</em> that is responsible for managing a set of
            <em>services</em>. A service consists of a Python class which binds its member functions to various <em>events</em>.
            The engine arranges to have the bound member function called when a specific event happens, such as a new
            LOOP packet arriving.
        </p>

        <p>
            The services are specified in lists in the <a href="usersguide.htm#engine_services"><span class="code">[Engine][[Services]]</span></a>
            stanza of the configuration file. The <span class="code">[[Services]]</span> section lists all the services
            to be run, broken up into different <em>service lists</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            These lists are designed to orchestrate the data as it flows through the WeeWX engine. For example, you want
            to make sure data has been processed by, for example, running it through the quality control service, <span
            class="code">StdQC</span>, before putting them in the database. Similarly, the reporting system must come
            <em>after</em> the archiving service. These groups insure that things happen in the proper sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the table <a href="#default_services">Default services</a> for a list of the services that are normally
            run.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Customizing_a_service">Modifying an existing service</h2>

        <p>
            The service <span class="code">weewx.engine.StdPrint</span> prints out new LOOP and archive packets to the
            console when they arrive. By default, it prints out the entire record, which generally includes a lot of
            possibly distracting information and can be rather messy. Suppose you do not like this, and want it to print
            out only the time, barometer reading, and the outside temperature whenever a new LOOP packet arrives. This
            could be done by subclassing the default print service <span class="code">StdPrint</span> and overriding
            member function <span class="code">new_loop_packet()</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Create the file <span class="code">user/myprint.py</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">from weewx.engine import StdPrint
from weeutil.weeutil import timestamp_to_string

class MyPrint(StdPrint):

    # Override the default new_loop_packet member function:
    def new_loop_packet(self, event):
        packet = event.packet
        print "LOOP: ", timestamp_to_string(packet['dateTime']),
            "BAR=",  packet.get('barometer', 'N/A'),
            "TEMP=", packet.get('outTemp', 'N/A')</pre>
        <p>
            This service substitutes a new implementation for the member function <span
            class="code">new_loop_packet</span>. This implementation prints out the time, then the barometer reading (or
            <span class="code">N/A</span> if it is not available) and the outside temperature (or <span
            class="code">N/A</span>).
        </p>

        <p>
            You then need to specify that your print service class should be loaded instead of the default <span
            class="code">StdPrint</span> service. This is done by substituting your service name for <span class="code">StdPrint</span>
            in <span class="code">service_list</span>, located in <span class="code">[Engine][[Services]]</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[Engine]
    [[Services]]
        ...
        report_services = <span class="highlight">user.myprint.MyPrint</span>, weewx.engine.StdReport</pre>
        <p>
            Note that the <span class="code">report_services</span> must be all on one line. Unfortunately, the parser
            <span class="code">ConfigObj</span> does not allow options to be continued on to following lines.
        </p>


        <h2 id="Adding_a_service">Creating a new service</h2>

        <p>
            Suppose there is no service that can be easily customized for your needs. In this case, a new one can easily
            be created by subclassing off the abstract base class <span class="code">StdService</span>, and then adding
            the functionality you need. Here is an example that implements an alarm, which sends off an email when an
            arbitrary expression evaluates <span class="code">True</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This service expects all the information it needs to be in the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            in a new section called <span class="code">[Alarm]</span>. So, add the following lines to your configuration
            file:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[Alarm]

    time_wait = 3600
    smtp_host = smtp.example.com

        <p>
            There are three important points to be noted in this example, each marked with a <span
            class="code">NOTE</span> flag in the code.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Here is where the binding happens between an event, <span class="code">weewx.NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD</span>
                in this example, and a member function, <span class="code">self.new_archive_record</span>. When the
                event <span class='code'>NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD</span> occurs, the function <span class="code">self.new_archive_record</span>
                will be called. There are many other events that can be intercepted. Look in the file <span
                    class="code">weewx/__init__.py</span>.
            </li>
            <li>Some hardware does not emit all possible observation types in every record. So, it's possible that a
                record may be missing some types that are used in the expression. This try block will catch the <span
                    class="code">NameError</span> exception that would be raised should this occur.
            </li>
            <li>This is where the test is done for whether or not to sound the alarm. The <span
                class="code">[Alarm]</span> configuration options specify that the alarm be sounded when <span
                class="code">outTemp &lt; 40.0</span> evaluates <span class="code">True</span>, that is when the outside
                temperature is below 40.0 degrees. Any valid Python expression can be used, although the only variables
                available are those in the current archive record.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Another example expression could be:</p>
        <pre class="tty">expression = "outTemp &lt; 32.0 and windSpeed &gt; 10.0"</pre>
        <p>In this case, the alarm is sounded if the outside temperature drops below freezing and the wind speed is
            greater than 10.0.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that units must be the same as whatever is being used in your database. That is, the same as what you
            specified in option <a href="usersguide.htm#option_target_unit"><span class="code">target_unit</span></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Option <span class="code">time_wait</span> is used to avoid a flood of nearly identical emails. The new
            service will wait this long before sending another email out.
        </p>

        <p>
            Email will be sent through the SMTP host specified by option <span class="code">smtp_host</span>. The
            recipient(s) are specified by the comma separated option <span class="code">mailto</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many SMTP hosts require user login. If this is the case, the user and password are specified with options
            <span class="code">smtp_user</span> and <span class="code">smtp_password</span>, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            The last two options, <span class="code">from</span> and <span class="code">subject</span> are optional. If
            not supplied, WeeWX will supply something sensible. Note, however, that some mailers require a valid "from"
            email address and the one WeeWX supplies may not satisfy its requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make this all work, you must first copy the <span class="code">alarm.py</span> file to the <span
            class="code">user</span> directory. Then tell the engine to load this new service by adding the service name
            to the list <span class="code">report_services</span>, located in <span
            class="code">[Engine][[Services]]</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[Engine]
   [[Services]]
        report_services = weewx.engine.StdPrint, weewx.engine.StdReport<span
                class="highlight">, user.alarm.MyAlarm</span></pre>
        <p>
            Again, note that the option <span class="code">report_services</span> must be all on one line &mdash; the
            parser <span class="code">ConfigObj</span> does not allow options to be continued on to following lines.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to this example, the distribution also includes a low-battery alarm (<span class="code">lowBattery.py</span>),
            which is similar, except that it intercepts LOOP events (instead of archiving events).
        </p>


        <h2 id="Adding_2nd_source">Adding a second data source</h2>

        <p>A very common problem is wanting to augment the data from your weather station with data from some other
            device. Generally, you have two approaches for how to handle this:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run two instances of WeeWX, each using its own database and <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span>
                configuration file. The results are then combined in a final report, using WeeWX's ability <a
                    href="#Using_multiple_bindings">to use more than one database</a>. See the Wiki entry <a
                    href="https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/weewx-multi"> <em>How to run multiple instances of
                    WeeWX</em></a> for details on how to do this.
            </li>
            <li>Run one instance, but use a custom WeeWX service to augment the records coming from your weather station
                with data from the other device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This section covers the latter approach.</p>

        <p>Suppose you have installed an electric meter at your house and you wish to correlate electrical usage with
            the weather. The meter has some sort of connection to your computer, allowing you to download the total
            power consumed. At the end of every archive interval you want to calculate the amount of power consumed
            during the interval, then add the results to the record coming off your weather station. How would you do
            this?
        </p>

        <p>Here is the outline of a service that retrieves the electrical consumption data and adds it to the archive
            record. It assumes that you already have a function <span class='code'>download_total_power()</span> that,
            somehow, downloads the amount of power consumed since time zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            File <span class="code">user/electricity.py</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">import weewx
from weewx.engine import StdService

class AddElectricity(StdService):

    def __init__(self, engine, config_dict):

      # Initialize my superclass first:
      super(AddElectricity, self).__init__(engine, config_dict)

      # Bind to any new archive record events:
      self.bind(weewx.NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD, self.new_archive_record)

      self.last_total = None

    def new_archive_record(self, event):

        total_power = download_total_power()

        if self.last_total:
            net_consumed = total_power - self.last_total
            event.record['electricity'] = net_consumed

        self.last_total = total_power</pre>
        <p>
            This adds a new key <span class="code">electricity</span> to the record dictionary and sets it equal to the
            difference between the amount of power currently consumed and the amount consumed at the last archive
            record. Hence, it will be the amount of power consumed over the archive interval. The unit should be
            Watt-hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an aside, it is important that the function <span class='code'>download_total_power()</span> does not
            delay very long because it will sit right in the main loop of the WeeWX engine. If it's going to cause a
            delay of more than a couple seconds you might want to put it in a separate thread and feed the results to
            <span class="code">AddElectricity</span> through a queue.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make sure your service gets run, you need to add it to one of the service lists in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>,
            section <span class="code">[Engine]</span>, subsection <span class="code">[[Services]]</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our case, the obvious place for our new service is in <span class="code">data_services</span>. When
            you're done, your section <span class="code">[Engine]</span> will look something like this:
        </p>

        <h1 id="archive_database">Customizing the database</h1>

        <p>For most users the default database will work just fine. However, there may be occasions
            where you may want to add a new SQL type to your database, or change its unit system.
            This section shows you how to do this.
        </p>

        <h2 id="add_archive_type">Adding a new type to the database</h2>

        <p>
            It is not unusual to have observation types that exist in the loop packets and/or archive records, but are
            not in the database schema. An example is the new observation type <span class="code">electricity</span>,
            from the example, <a href="#Adding_2nd_source"><em>Adding a second data source</em></a>. If a type is not in
            the database schema, then it will be a second class citizen in WeeWX's world: it cannot be used in a plot,
            nor for most statistics. So how would you add such a type to the database schema?
        </p>

        <p>
            The utility <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><span class="code">wee_database</span></a> can do
            this. It will create a new database that is similar to the old database, except it will have the new type in
            its schema.
        </p>

        <p class="note" style="display: inline-block; width: 70%">
            <strong>Note</strong><br/>It is possible to observe all of the observation types included in the loop
            packets and archive records, whether or not they are stored in the database, by <a
            href="usersguide.htm#Running_directly">running WeeWX directly</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Here's our general strategy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Extend the existing schema with the new type.
            </li>
            <li>Modify the <span class="code">wx_binding</span> to use the new schema instead of the old.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create a new database.
            </li>
            <li>Use the utility <span class="code">wee_database</span> to create the new database and populate it with
                data from the old database.
            </li>
            <li>Shuffle databases around so WeeWX will use the new database.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is the recipe that follows that strategy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Extend the existing schema with the new type.</strong> The schema that
                    comes with WeeWX is a superset of the schema that the weather program
                    <em>wview</em> uses. It's located in the file <span
                    class="code">schemas/wview_extended.py</span> &mdash; take a look at it now. We
                    could just modify it <em>in situ</em>, but that would run the risk of confusing
                    the two versions. Besides, our changes would get lost at the next upgrade.
                    Alternatively, we could copy the file over to a new location, and then modify
                    that. But, because our change is just a simple addition, we're going to import
                    the old schema, then just add on our new type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this example, we are going to add a few lines of code to the bottom of the file <span
                    class="code">user/electricity.py</span>:
                </p>
                <pre class="tty">import schemas.wview_extended

schema_with_electricity = {
    'table': schemas.wview_extended.table + [('electricity', 'REAL')],
    'day_summaries' : schemas.wview_extended.day_summaries + [('electricity', 'SCALAR')]
}
</pre>
                <p>
                    This creates a new schema with the name <span
                    class="code">user.electricity.schema_with_electricity</span>, which is just
                    like the old one, except it has a new type, <span
                    class="code">electricity</span>, tacked on to the end of both the main archive
                    table, and the daily summaries. Its schema type is REAL. Its corresponding
                    daily summary will treat it as a SCALAR.
                </p>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Modify <span class="code">wx_binding</span>.</strong> When it creates the new, modified
                    database, <span class="code">wee_database</span> needs to know to use your new schema instead of the
                    old, wview schema. You do this by changing the option <span class="code">schema</span> in section
                    <span class="code">[DataBindings]</span> in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span class="code">[DataBindings]</span> section now looks like this:
                </p>

                <pre class="tty">[DataBindings]
    [[wx_binding]]
        database = archive_sqlite

        <span class="highlight">schema = user.electricity.electricity_schema</span></pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Check permissions.</strong> <span class="code">wee_database</span> will create a new
                    database with the same name as the old, except with the suffix <span class="code">_new</span>
                    attached to the end. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create it. In particular, if
                    you are using MySQL, you will need <span class="code">CREATE</span> privileges:
                </p>
                <pre class="tty">mysql&gt; <span class="cmd">GRANT select, update, create, delete, insert ON weewx_new.* TO weewx@localhost;</span></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Create and populate the new database.</strong> Now run the utility <span class="code">wee_database</span>
                    with the <span class="code">--reconfigure</span> option and the path to the configuration file:
                </p>

                <p class="tty cmd">wee_database weewx.conf --reconfigure</p>

                <p>
                    This will create a new database (nominally, <span class="code">weewx.sdb_new</span> if you are using
                    SQLite, <span class="code">weewx_new</span> if you are using MySQL) using the new schema and
                    populate it with data from the old database.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Shuffle the databases.</strong> Now arrange things so WeeWX can find the new database.
                </p>

                <p class="warning">
                    <strong>Warning!</strong><br/> Make a backup of the data before doing any of the next steps!
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can either shuffle the databases around so the new database has the same name as the old
                    database, or edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> to use the new database name. To do the
                    former:
                </p>

                <p>For SQLite:</p>
                <pre class="tty cmd">cd <span class="symcode">SQLITE_ROOT</span>
mv weewx.sdb_new weewx.sdb</pre>
                <p>For MySQL:</p>
                <pre class="tty"><span class="cmd">mysql -u &lt;username&gt; --password=&lt;mypassword&gt;</span>
mysql&gt;<span class="cmd"> DROP DATABASE weewx;</span>                             # Delete the old database

mysql&gt;<span class="cmd"> RENAME TABLE weewx_new.archive TO weewx.archive;</span> # Rename to the nominal name</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    It's worth noting that there's actually a hidden, last step: rebuilding the daily summaries inside
                    the new database. This will be done automatically by WeeWX at the next startup. Alternatively, it
                    can be done manually using the <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><span class="code">wee_database</span></a>
                    utility and the <span class="code">--rebuild-daily</span> option:
                </p>
                <pre class="tty cmd">wee_database weewx.conf --rebuild-daily</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>


        <h2 id="Changing_the_unit_system">Changing the database unit system</h2>

        <p>
            Normally, data are stored in the databases using US Customary units and, normally, you don't care; it is an
            "implementation detail". Data can always be displayed using any set of units you want. The section <a
            href="#how_to_change_units"><em>How to change units</em></a> explains how to do this. Nevertheless, there
            may be special situations where you wish to store the data in Metric units. For example, you may need to
            allow direct programmatic access to the database from another piece of software that expects metric units.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should not change the database unit system midstream. That is, do not start with one unit system then,
            in the middle of the database, switch to another. See the section <span class="code"> <a
            href="usersguide.htm#StdConvert">[StdConvert]</a></span> in the WeeWX User's Guide. However, you can
            reconfigure the database by copying it to a new database, performing the unit conversion along the way. You
            then use this new database.
        </p>

        <p>Here is the general strategy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Modify <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> to reflect your choice of the new unit system to use. Your
                choices are <span class='code'>US</span>, <span class="code">METRIC</span>, or <span class="code">METRICWX</span>.
                See the <em><a href="#units">Appendix: Units</a></em> for the exact differences between these three
                choices.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create the new database.
            </li>
            <li>Use the utility <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><span class="code">wee_database</span></a>

                <p>
                    You can either shuffle the databases around so the new database has the same name as the old
                    database, or edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> to use the new database name. To do the

                    It's worth noting that there's actually a hidden, last step: rebuilding the daily summaries inside
                    the new database. This will be done automatically by WeeWX at the next startup. Alternatively, it
                    can be done manually using the <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><span class="code">wee_database</span></a>
                    utility and the <span class="code">--rebuild-daily</span> option:

        <h2>Rebuilding the daily summaries</h2>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">wee_database</span> utility can also be used to rebuild the daily summaries:
        </p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">wee_database weewx.conf --rebuild-daily</pre>

        <p>In most cases this will be sufficient; however, if anomalies remain in the daily summaries the daily summary
            tables may be dropped first before rebuilding:
        </p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">wee_database weewx.conf --drop-daily</pre>

        <p>
            The summaries will automatically be rebuilt the next time WeeWX starts, or they can be rebuilt with the
            utility:

        <h1 id="customizing_units">Customizing units and unit groups</h1>

        <p class="warning">
            <strong>Warning!</strong><br/> This is an area that is rapidly changing in WeeWX. Presently, new units and
            unit groups are added by manipulating the internal dictionaries in WeeWX (as described below). In the
            future, they may be specified in <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>Assigning a unit group</h2>
        <p>
            In the examples above, we created a new observation type, <span class='code'>electricity</span>, and added
            it to the database schema. Now we would like to recognize that it is a member of the unit group <span
            class='code'>group_energy</span> (which already exists), so it can enjoy the labels and formats already
            provided for this group. This is done by extending the dictionary <span class='code'>weewx.units.obs_group_dict</span>.
        </p>

        <p>Add the following to our new services file <span class='code'>user/electricity.py</span>, just after the last
            import statement:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">import weewx
from weewx.engine import StdService
<span class="highlight">
import weewx.units
weewx.units.obs_group_dict['electricity'] = 'group_energy'</span>

class AddElectricity(StdService):

   # [...]</pre>

        <p>When our new service gets loaded by the WeeWX engine, these few lines will get run. They tell WeeWX that our
            new observation type, <span class='code'>electricity</span>, is part of the unit group <span class='code'>group_energy</span>.
            Once the observation has been associated with a unit group, the unit labels and other tag syntax will work
            for that observation. So, now a tag like:
        </p>
        <pre class='tty'>$month.electricity.sum</pre>
        <p>will return the total amount of electricity consumed for the month, in Watt-hours.</p>

        <h2>Creating a new unit group</h2>
        <p>
            That was an easy one, because there was already an existing group, <span class='code'>group_energy</span>,
            that covered our new observation type. But, what if we are measuring something entirely new, like force with
            time? There is nothing in the existing system of units that covers things like newtons or pounds. We will
            have to define these new units, as well as the unit group they can belong to.
        </p>
        <p>
            We assume we have a new observation type, <span class='code'>force</span>, that we are measuring over time,
            for a service named <span class="code">Rocket</span>, located in <span class='code'>
        user/rocket.py</span>. We will create a new unit group, <span class='code'>group_force</span>, and new units,
            <span class='code'>newton</span> and <span class='code'>pound</span>. Our new observation, <span
            class='code'>force</span>, will belong to <span class='code'>group_force</span>, and will be measured in
            units of <span class='code'>newton</span> or <span class='code'>pound</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make this work, we need to add the following to <span class="code">user/rocket.py</span>.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>As before, we start by specifying what group our new observation type belongs to:
                <pre class='tty'>
import weewx.units
weewx.units.obs_group_dict['force'] = 'group_force'</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Next, we specify what unit is used to measure force in the three standard unit systems used by weewx.
                <pre class='tty'>
weewx.units.USUnits['group_force'] = 'pound'
weewx.units.MetricUnits['group_force'] = 'newton'
weewx.units.MetricWXUnits['group_force'] = 'newton'</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Then we specify what formats and labels to use for <span class='code'>newton</span> and <span
                class='code'>pound</span>:
                <pre class='tty'>
weewx.units.default_unit_format_dict['newton'] = '%.1f'
weewx.units.default_unit_format_dict['pound']  = '%.1f'

weewx.units.default_unit_label_dict['newton'] = ' newton'
weewx.units.default_unit_label_dict['pound']  = ' pound'</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Finally, we specify how to convert between them:
                <pre class='tty'>
weewx.units.conversionDict['newton'] = {'pound':  lambda x : x * 0.224809}
weewx.units.conversionDict['pound']  = {'newton': lambda x : x * 4.44822}
</pre>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now, when the service <span class="code">Rocket</span> gets loaded, these lines of code will get executed,
            adding the necessary unit extensions to WeeWX.
        </p>

        <h2>Using the new units</h2>

        <p>Now you've added a new type of units. How do you use it?</p>

        <p>
            Pretty much like any other units. For example, to do a plot of the month's electric consumption, totaled by
            day, add this section to the <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span> section of <span class="code">skin.conf</span>:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[[[monthelectric]]]
    [[[[electricity]]]]
        aggregate_type = sum
        aggregate_interval = 86400
        label = Electric consumption (daily total)</pre>
        <p>
            This will cause the generation of an image <span class="code">monthelectric.png</span>, showing a plot of
            each day's consumption for the past month.
        </p>

        <p>If you wish to use the new type in the templates, it will be available using the same syntax as any other
            type. Here are some other tags that might be useful:
        </p>
        <table class="indent">
            <tbody>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td>Tag</td>

        <h1 id="porting">Porting to new hardware</h1>

        <p>Naturally, this is an advanced topic but, nevertheless, I'd like to encourage any Python wizards out there to
            give it a try. Of course, I have selfish reasons for this: I don't want to have to buy every weather station
            ever invented, and I don't want my roof to look like a weather station farm!
        </p>

        <p>
            A <em>driver</em> communicates with hardware. Each driver is a single python file that contains the code
            that is the interface between a device and WeeWX. A driver may communicate directly with hardware using a
            MODBus, USB, serial, or other physical interface. Or it may communicate over a network to a physical device
            or a web service.
        </p>

        <h2>General guidelines</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The driver should emit data as it receives it from the hardware (no caching).
            </li>
            <li>The driver should emit only data it receives from the hardware (no "filling in the gaps").
            </li>
            <li>The driver should not modify the data unless the modification is directly related to the hardware (<i>e.g.</i>,
                decoding a hardware-specific sensor value).
            </li>
            <li>If the hardware flags "bad data", then the driver should emit a null value for that datum (Python <span
                class="code">None</span>).
            </li>
            <li>The driver should not calculate any derived variables (such as dewpoint). The service <span
                class="code">StdWXService</span> will do that.
            </li>
            <li>However, if the hardware emits a derived variable, then the driver should emit it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implement the driver</h2>

        <p>
            Create a file in the user directory, say <span class="code">mydriver.py</span>. This file will contain the
            driver class as well as any hardware-specific code. Do not put it in the <span
            class="code">weewx/drivers</span> directory or it will be deleted when you upgrade WeeWX.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inherit from the abstract base class <span class="code">weewx.drivers.AbstractDevice</span>. Try to
            implement as many of its methods as you can. At the very minimum, you must implement the first three
            methods, <span class="code">loader</span>, <span class="code">hardware_name</span>, and <span class="code">genLoopPackets</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="code">loader</span>
        </h3>

        <p>This is a factory function that returns an instance of your driver. It has two arguments: the configuration
            dictionary, and a reference to the WeeWX engine.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="code">hardware_name</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            Return a string with a short nickname for the hardware, such as <span class="code">"ACME X90"</span>
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="code">genLoopPackets</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            This should be a Python <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator function</a> that yields
            loop packets, one after another. Don't worry about stopping it: the engine will do this when an archive
            record is due. A "loop packet" is a dictionary. At the very minimum it must contain keys for the observation
            time and for the units used within the packet.
        </p>
        <table class="indent" style="width: 60%">
            <caption>Required keys</caption>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">dateTime</td>
                <td>The time of the observation in unix epoch time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code first_col">usUnits</td>
                <td>The unit system used. <span class="code">weewx.US</span> for US customary, <span class="code">weewx.METRICWX</span>,
                    or <span class="code">weewx.METRIC</span> for metric. See the file <span
                        class="code">units.py</span>, dictionaries <span class="code">USUnits</span>, <span
                        class="code">MetricWXUnits</span>, and <span class="code">MetricUnits</span> for the exact
                    definition of each.
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            Then include any observation types you have in the dictionary. Every packet need not contain the same set of
            observation types. Different packets can use different unit systems, but all observations within a packet
            must use the same unit system. If your hardware is capable of measuing an observation type but, for whatever
            reason, its value is bad (maybe a bad checksum?), then set its value to <span class="code">None</span>. If
            your hardware is incapable of measuring an observation type, then leave it out of the dictionary.
        </p>

        <p>
            A couple of observation types are tricky. In particular, <span class="code">rain</span>. Generally, WeeWX
            expects to see a packet with the amount of rain that fell in that packet period included as observation
            <span class="code">rain</span>. It then sums up all the values to get the total rainfall and emits that in
            the archive record. If your hardware does not provide this value, you might have to infer it from changes in
            whatever value it provides, for example changes in the daily or monthly rainfall. I know this is not the
            best solution, but it is the most general solution. Any alternatives are welcome!
        </p>

        <p>
            Wind is another tricky one. It is actually broken up into four different observations: <span class="code">windSpeed</span>,
            <span class="code">windDir</span>, <span class="code">windGust</span>, and <span
            class="code">windGustDir</span>. Supply as many as you can. The directions should be compass directions in
            degrees (0=North, 90=East, etc.).
        </p>

        <p>Be careful when reporting pressure. There are three observations related to pressure. Some stations report
            only the station pressure, others calculate and report sea level pressures.
        </p>

        </h3>

        <p>
            If your hardware does not have an archive record logger, then WeeWX can do the record generation for you. It
            will automatically collect all the types it sees in your loop packets then emit a record with the averages
            (in some cases the sum or max value) of all those types. If it doesn't see a type, then it won't appear in
            the emitted record.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if your hardware does have a logger, then you should implement method <span class="code">genArchiveRecords()</span>
            as well. It should be a generator function that returns all the records since a given time.

        <p>
            If you implement function <span class="code">genArchiveRecords()</span>, then you should also implement
            <span class='code'>archive_interval</span> as either an attribute, or as a <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property">property function</a>. It should return the
            archive interval in seconds.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="code">getTime()</span>
        </h3>

        <p>If your hardware has an onboard clock and supports reading the time from it, then you may want to implement
            this method. It takes no argument. It should return the time in Unix Epoch Time.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="code">setTime()</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            If your hardware has an onboard clock and supports <em>setting</em> it, then you may want to implement this
            method. It takes no argument and does not need to return anything.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="code">closePort()</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
            If the driver needs to close a serial port, terminate a thread, close a database, or perform any other
            activity before the application terminates, then you must supply this function. WeeWX will call it if it
            needs to shut down your console (usually in the case of an error).
        </p>

        <h2>Define the configuration</h2>

        <p>
            You then include a new section in the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> that includes
            any options your driver needs. It should also include an entry <span class="code">driver</span> that points
            to where your driver can be found. Set option <span class="code">station_type</span> to your new section
            type and your driver will be loaded.
        </p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>

        <p>
            The <span class='code'>fileparse</span> driver is perhaps the simplest example of a WeeWX driver. It reads
            name-value pairs from a file and uses the values as sensor 'readings'. The code is actually packaged as an
            extension, located in <span class="code">examples/fileparse</span>, making it a good example of not only
            writing a device driver, but also of how to package an extension. The actual driver itself is in <span
            class="code">examples/fileparse/bin/user/fileparse.py</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another good example is the simulator code located in <span class='code'>weewx/drivers/simulator.py</span>.
            It's dirt simple and you can easily play with it. Many people have successfully used it as a starting point
            for writing their own custom driver.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Ultimeter (<span class="code">ultimeter.py</span>) and WMR100 (<span class="code">wmr100.py</span>)
            drivers illustrate how to communicate with serial and USB hardware, respectively. They also show different
            approaches for decoding data. Nevertheless, they are pretty straightforward.
        </p>

        <p>
            The driver for the Vantage series is by far the most complicated. It actually multi-inherits from not only
            <span class="code">AbstractDevice</span>, but also <span class="code">StdService</span>. That is, it also
            participates in the engine as a service.
        </p>

        <p>Naturally, there are a lot of subtleties that have been glossed over in this high-level description. If you
            run into trouble, look for help in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/weewx-development">

        <h1 id="extensions">Extensions</h1>

        <p>
            A key feature of WeeWX is its ability to be extended by installing 3rd party <em>extensions</em>. Extensions
            are a way to package one or more customizations so they can be installed and distributed as a functional
            group.
        </p>

        <p>Customizations typically fall into one of these categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>search list extension</li>
            <li>template</li>
            <li>skin</li>
            <li>service</li>
            <li>generator</li>
            <li>driver</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki"> WeeWX wiki </a> for a sampling of some of
            the extensions that are available.
        </p>


        <!-- Utility wee_extension moved to utilities.htm -->


        <h2>Creating an extension</h2>

        <p>
            Now that you have made some customizations, you might want to share those changes with other WeeWX users.
            Put your customizations into an extension to make installation, removal, and distribution easier.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a few guidelines for creating extensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extensions should not modify or depend upon existing skins. An extension should include its own,
                standalone skin to illustrate any templates, search list extension, or generator features.
            </li>
            <li>Extensions should not modify the database schemas. If it requires data not found in the default
                databases, an extension should provide its own database and schema.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Although one extension might use another extension, take care to write the dependent extension so that it
            fails gracefully. For example, a skin might use data the forecast extension, but what happens if the
            forecast extension is not installed? Make the skin display a message about "forecast not installed" but
            otherwise continue to function.
        </p>

        <h2>Packaging an extension</h2>

        <p>
            The structure of an extension mirrors that of WeeWX itself. If the customizations include a skin, the
            extension will have a skins directory. If the customizations include python code, the extension will have a
            <span class='code'>bin/user</span> directory.
        </p>

        <p>Each extension should also include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class='code'>readme.txt</span> - a summary of what the extension does, list of pre-requisites (if
                any), and instructions for installing the extension manually
            </li>
            <li><span class='code'>changelog</span> - an enumeration of changes in each release
            </li>
            <li><span class='code'>install.py</span> - python code used by the WeeWX ExtensionInstaller
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For example, here is the structure of a skin called <span class='code'>basic</span>:
        </p>

        <pre class='tty'>basic/
basic/changelog
basic/install.py
basic/readme.txt
basic/skins/
basic/skins/basic/
basic/skins/basic/basic.css
basic/skins/basic/current.inc
basic/skins/basic/favicon.ico
basic/skins/basic/hilo.inc
basic/skins/basic/index.html.tmpl
basic/skins/basic/skin.conf</pre>

        <p>
            Here is the structure of a search list extension called <span class='code'>xstats</span>:
        </p>

        <pre class='tty'>xstats/
xstats/changelog
xstats/install.py
xstats/readme.txt
xstats/bin/
xstats/bin/user/
xstats/bin/user/xstats.py</pre>

        <p>
            See the <span class='code'>extensions</span> directory of the WeeWX source for examples.
        </p>

        <p>To distribute an extension, simply create a compressed archive of the extension directory.</p>

        <p>
            For example, create the compressed archive for the <span class='code'>basic</span> skin like this:
        </p>

        <p class='tty cmd'>tar cvfz basic.tar.gz basic</p>

        <p>Once an extension has been packaged, it can be installed using the <a
            href="utilities.htm#wee_extension_utility">wee_extension</a> utility.
        </p>

        <h2>Default values</h2>

        <p>
            Whenever possible, an extension should <em>just work</em>, with a minimum of input from the user. At the
            same time, parameters for the most frequently requested options should be easily accessible and easy to
            modify. For skins, this might mean parameterizing strings into <span class="code">[Labels]</span> for easier
            customization. Or it might mean providing parameters in <span class="code">[Extras]</span> to control skin
            behavior or to parameterize links.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some parameters <em>must</em> be specified, and no default value would be appropriate. For example, an
            uploader may require a username and password, or a driver might require a serial number or IP address. In
            these cases, use a default value in the configuration that will obviously require modification. The <em>username</em>
            might default to <em>REPLACE_ME</em>. Also be sure to add a log entry that indicates the feature is disabled
            until the value has been specified.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of drivers, use the configuration editor to prompt for this type of required value.
        </p>


        <h1 id="report_options">Reference: report options</h1>

        <p>
            This section contains the options available in the skin configuration file, <span
            class="code">skin.conf</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most important options, the ones you are likely to have to customize, are <span
            class="config_important"><strong>highlighted</strong></span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is worth noting that, like the main configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, UTF-8 is
            used throughout.
        </p>


        <h2 class="config_section" id="Extras">[Extras]</h2>

        <p>This section is available to add any static tags you might want to use in your templates.</p>

        <p>
            As an example, the <span class="code">skin.conf</span> file for the <em>Seasons</em> skin includes three
            options:
        </p>
        <table class="indent" style="width: 50%">
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td>Skin option</td>
                <td>Template tag</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code">radar_img</td>
                <td class="code">$Extras.radar_img</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code">radar_url</td>
                <td class="code">$Extras.radar_url</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="code">googleAnalyticsId</td>
                <td class="code">$Extras.googleAnalyticsId</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            If you take a look at the template <span class="code">radar.inc</span> you will see examples of testing for
            these tags.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">radar_img</p>

        <p>Set to an URL to show a local radar image for your region.</p>

        <p class="config_option">radar_url</p>

        <p>If the radar image is clicked, the browser will go to this URL. This is usually used to show a more detailed,
            close-up, radar picture.
        </p>

        <p>For me in Oregon, setting the two options to:</p>
        <pre class="tty">
[Extras]
    radar_img = http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/lite/N0R/RTX_loop.gif
    radar_url = http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/radar.php?product=NCR&amp;rid=RTX&amp;loop=yes</pre>
        <p>
            results in a nice image of a radar centered on Portland, Oregon. When you click on it, it gives you a
            detailed, animated view. If you live in the USA, take a look at the <a href="http://radar.weather.gov/">NOAA
            radar website</a> to find a nice one that will work for you. In other countries, you will have to consult
            your local weather service.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">googleAnalyticsId</p>

        <p>
            If you have a <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics ID</a>, you can set it here. The
            Google Analytics Javascript code will then be included, enabling analytics of your website usage. If
            commented out, the code will not be included.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Extending <span class="code">[Extras]</span>
        </h3>

        <p>Other tags can be added in a similar manner, including sub-sections. For example, say you have added a video
            camera and you would like to add a still image with a hyperlink to a page with the video. You want all of
            these options to be neatly contained in a sub-section.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">[Extras]
    [[video]]
        still = video_capture.jpg
        hyperlink = <a href="http://www.eatatjoes.com/video.html">http://www.eatatjoes.com/video.html</a>
      </pre>
        <p>Then in your template you could refer to these as:</p>
        <pre class="tty">&lt;a href="$Extras.video.hyperlink"&gt;
    &lt;img src="$Extras.video.still" alt="Video capture"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

        <h2 class="config_section">[Labels]</h2>

        <p>This section defines various labels.</p>

        <p class="config_option">hemispheres</p>

        <p>
            Comma separated list for the labels to be used for the four hemispheres. The default is <span class="code">N, S, E, W</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">latlon_formats</p>

        <p>Comma separated list for the formatting to be used when converting latitude and longitude to strings. There
            should be three elements:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The format to be used for whole degrees of latitude</li>
            <li>The format to be used for whole degrees of longitude</li>
            <li>The format to be used for minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This allows you to decide whether or not you want leading zeroes. The default includes leading zeroes and is
            &quot;%02d&quot;, &quot;%03d&quot;, &quot;%05.2f&quot;
        </p>

        <h3 class="config_section" id="Labels_Generic">[[Generic]]</h3>

        <p>This sub-section specifies default labels to be used for each observation type. For example, options</p>
        <pre class="tty">inTemp  = Temperature inside the house
outTemp = Outside Temperature
UV      = UV Index</pre>
        <p>
            would cause the given labels to be used for plots of <span class="code">inTemp</span> and <span
            class="code">outTemp</span>. If no option is given, then the observation type itself will be used
            (<i>e.g.</i>, <span class="code">outTemp</span>).
        </p>

        <h2 class="config_section">[Almanac]</h2>

        <p>This section controls what text to use for the almanac. It consists of only one entry</p>

        <p class="config_option">moon_phases</p>

        <p>
            This option is a comma separated list of labels to be used for the eight phases of the moon. Default is
            <span class="code">New,
          Waxing crescent, First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning
          gibbous, Last quarter, Waning crescent</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="config_section">[Units]</h2>

        <p>This section controls how units are managed and displayed.</p>

        <h3 class="config_section">[[Groups]]</h3>

        <p>
            This sub-section lists all the <em>Unit Groups</em> and specifies which unit system is to be used for each
            one of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            As there are many different observational measurement types (such as <span class="code">outTemp</span>,
            <span class="code">barometer</span>, etc.) used in WeeWX (more than 50 at last count), it would be tedious,
            not to say possibly inconsistent, to specify a different measurement system for each one of them. At the
            other extreme, requiring all of them to be "U.S. Customary" or "Metric" seems overly restrictive. WeeWX has
            taken a middle route and divided all the different observation types into 12 different <em>unit groups</em>.
            A unit group is something like <span class="code">group_temperature</span>. It represents the measurement
            system to be used by all observation types that are measured in temperature, such as inside temperature
            (type <span class="code">inTemp</span>), outside temperature (<span class="code">outTemp</span>), dewpoint (<span
            class="code">dewpoint</span>), wind chill (<span class="code">windchill</span>), and so on. If you decide
            that you want unit group <span class="code">group_temperature</span> to be measured in <span class="code">degree_C</span>
            then you are saying <em>all</em> members of its group will be reported in degrees Celsius.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the unit system is always specified in the singular. That is, specify <span
            class="code">degree_C</span> or <span class="code">foot</span>, not <span class="code">degrees_C</span> or
            <span class="code">feet</span>. See the <em><a href="#units">Appendix: Units</a></em> for more information,
            including a concise summary of the groups, their members, and which options can be used for each group.
        </p>

        <p class="config_important">
            <a class="config_option" id="group_altitude">group_altitude</a>

        <p class="config_important">group_pressure</p>

        <p>
            The measurement unit to be used for pressure. Possible options are one of <span class="code">inHg</span>

        <p class="config_important">group_speed</p>

        <p>
            The measurement unit to be used for wind speeds. Possible options are one of <span class="code">mile_per_hour</span>,
            <span class="code">km_per_hour</span>, <span class="code">knot</span>, or <span class="code">meter_per_second</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="config_important">group_speed2</p>

        <p>
            This group is similar to <span class="code">group_speed</span>, but is used for calculated wind speeds which
            typically have a slightly higher resolution. Possible options are one <span
            class="code">mile_per_hour2</span>, <span class="code">km_per_hour2</span>, <span class="code">knot2</span>,
            or <span class="code">meter_per_second2</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a class="config_important" id="group_temperature">group_temperature</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The measurement unit to be used for temperatures. Options are <span class="code">degree_F</span> or <span
            class="code">degree_C</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">group_volt</p>

        <p>
            The measurement unit to be used for voltages. The only option is <span class="code">volt</span>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="config_section" id="Units_StringFormats">[[StringFormats]]</h3>

        <p>This sub-section is used to specify what string format is to be used for each unit when a quantity needs to
            be converted to a string. Typically, this happens with y-axis labeling on plots and for statistics in HTML
            file generation. For example, the options
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">degree_C = %.1f
inch     = %.2f</pre>
        <p>
            would specify that the given string formats are to be used when formatting any temperature measured in
            degrees Celsius or any precipitation amount measured in inches, respectively. The <a
            href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language"> formatting codes are
            those used by Python</a>, and are very similar to C's <span class="code">sprintf()</span> codes.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also specify what string to use for an invalid or unavailable measurement (value <span class="code">None</span>).
            For example,
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">NONE = " N/A "</pre>

        <h3 class="config_section" id="Units_Labels">[[Labels]]</h3>

        <p>This sub-section specifies what label is to be used for each measurement unit type. For example, the options
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">degree_F = °F
inch     = ' in'</pre>
        <p>
            would cause all temperatures to have unit labels <span class="code">°F</span> and all precipitation to have
            labels <span class="code">in</span>. If any special symbols are to be used (such as the degree sign) they
            should be encoded in UTF-8. This is generally what most text editors use if you cut-and-paste from a
            character map.
        </p>

        <p>If the label includes two values, then the first is assumed to be the singular form, the second the plural
            form. For example,
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">foot   = " foot",   " feet"
...
day    = " day",    " days"
hour   = " hour",   " hours"
minute = " minute", " minutes"
second = " second", " seconds"</pre>

        <h3 class="config_section" id="Units_TimeFormats">[[TimeFormats]]</h3>

        <p>
            This sub-section is used for time labels. It uses <a
            href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior">strftime()</a> formats.
            The default looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre class='tty'>
    [[TimeFormats]]
        # This section sets the string format to be used for each time scale.
        # The values below will work in every locale, but may not look
        # particularly attractive. See the Customization Guide for alternatives.

        day        = %X
        week       = %X (%A)
        month      = %x %X
        year       = %x %X
        rainyear   = %x %X
        current    = %x %X
        ephem_day  = %X
        ephem_year = %x %X</pre>

        <p>
            The specifiers <span class='code'>%x</span>, <span class='code'>%X</span>, and <span class='code'>%A</span>
            code locale dependent date, time, and weekday names, respectively. Hence, if you set an appropriate
            environment variable <span class='code'>LANG</span>, then the date and times should follow local conventions
            (see section <a href="#environment_variable_LANG">Environment variable LANG</a> for details on how to do
            this). However, they will not look particularly pretty and you may want to change them. For example, I use
            this in the U.S.:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">
    [[TimeFormats]]
        #
        # More attractive formats that work in most Western countries.
        #
        day        = %H:%M
        week       = %H:%M on %A
        month      = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        year       = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        rainyear   = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        current    = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        ephem_day  = %H:%M
        ephem_year = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M</pre>

        <p>
            The last two formats, <span class='code'>ephem_day</span> and <span class='code'>ephem_year</span> allow the
            formatting to be set for almanac times The first, <span class="code">ephem_day</span>, is used for almanac
            times within the day, such as sunrise or sunset. The second, <span class="code">ephem_year</span>, is used
            for almanac times within the year, such as the next equinox or full moon.

        </p>

        <p>Set to the base temperature for calculating heating, cooling, and growing degree-days, along with the unit to
            be used. Examples:
        </p>

cooling_base = 20.0, degree_C
growing_base = 50.0, degree_F</pre>
        <h3 class="config_section" id="trend">[[Trend]]</h3>

        <p class="config_option">time_delta</p>

        <p>Set to the time difference over which you want trends to be calculated. The default is 3 hours.</p>

        <p class="config_option">time_grace</p>

        <p>
            When searching for a previous record to be used in calculating a trend, a record within this amount of <span

        <h2 id="CheetahGenerator">[CheetahGenerator]</h2>

        <p>This section contains the options for the Cheetah generator.</p>

        <p class="config_option">search_list</p>

        <p>
            This is the list of search list objects that will be scanned by the template engine, looking for tags. See
            the section <em><a href="#defining_new_tags">Defining new tags</a></em> and the <a
            href="http://pythonhosted.org/Cheetah/users_guide">Cheetah documentation</a> for details on search lists. If
            no <span class="config_option">search_list</span> is specified, a default list will be used. The default
            list is:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">search_list = weewx.cheetahgenerator.Almanac, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Station, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Stats, weewx.cheetahgenerator.UnitInfo, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Extras</pre>
        <p class="config_option">search_list_extensions</p>

        <p>
            This defines one or more search list objects that will be appended to the <span class="config_option">search_list</span>.
            For example, the following adds alltime and forecast variables to the search list.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">search_list_extensions = user.stats.MyStats, user.forecast.ForecastVariables</pre>
        <p class="config_option" id='option_encoding'>encoding</p>

        <p>
            As Cheetah goes through the template, it substitutes strings for all tag values. This option controls which
            encoding to use for the new strings. The encoding can be chosen on a per file basis. There are 3 possible
            choices:

            be substituted for the year, month, week and day of month, respectively. So, a template with the name <span
            class="code">summary-YYYY-MM.html.tmpl</span> would have name <span class="code">summary-2010-03.html</span>
            for the month of March, 2010.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option" id="stale_age">stale_age</p>

        <p>
            File staleness age, in seconds. If the file is older than this age it will be generated from the template.
            If no <span class="code">stale_age</span> is specified, then the file will be generated every time the

            Causes the vectors to be rotated by this many degrees. Positive is clockwise. If westerly winds dominate at
            your location (as they do at mine), then you may want to specify <span class="code">+90</span> for this
            option. This will cause the average vector to point straight up, rather than lie flat against the x-axis.
            Optional. The default is <span class='code'>0</span>.
        </p>


        <h3>Shared plot line options</h3>

        <p class="config_option">chart_line_width</p>

        <p>
            Each chart line can be drawn using a different line width. This option is a list of these widths. If the
            number of lines exceeds the length of the list, then the widths wrap around to the beginning of the list.
            Optional. Default is <span class="code">1, 1, 1</span>. <br/> <br/> Individual line widths can be overridden
            by using option <span class="code">width</span>.

            drawn, rather than a connecting line. See Section <em><a href="#line_gaps">Line gaps</a></em>. Optional. The
            default is to always draw the line.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">width</p>

        <p>
            This option is to override the line widthfor an individual line. Optional. Default is to use the width in

            href="#including_same_sql_type_2x">Including a type more than once in a plot</a></em>. Optional. The default
            is to use the section name.
        </p>


        <h2 class="config_section">[CopyGenerator]</h2>

        <p>
            This section is used by generator <span class="code">weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</span> and controls
            which files are to be copied over from the skin directory to the destination directory. Think of it as "file
            generation," except that rather than going through the template engine, the files are simply copied over.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">copy_once</p>

        <p>This option controls which files get copied over on the first invocation of the report engine service.
            Typically, this is things such as style sheets or background GIFs. Wildcards can be used.
        </p>

        <p class="config_option">copy_always</p>

        <p>This is a list of files that should be copied on every invocation. Wildcards can be used.</p>

        <p>

        <p>The Standard skin includes some background images, CSS files, and icons that need to be copied once. There
            are no files that need to be copied every time the generator runs.
        </p>


        <h2 class="config_section" id="generators_section">[Generators]</h2>

        <p>This section defines the list of generators that should be run.</p>

        <p class="config_option">generator_list</p>

        <p>This option controls which generators get run for this skin. It is a comma separated list. The generators
            will be run in this order.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is the <span class="code">[Generators]</span> section from the Standard <span
