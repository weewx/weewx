    <h1 class="title">Customizing weewx<br />
      <span class="version">
Version: 3.0.1
      </span>
    </h1>

      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      This document covers the customization of <span class="code">weewx</span>.
      It assumes that you have read, and are reasonably familiar with,
      the <a href="usersguide.htm">Users Guide</a>.
    </p>
    <p>It starts with an overview of the architecture of weewx. If you are
        only interested in customizing the generated reports you can probably
        skip the overview and proceed directly to the section
      <em><a href="#standard_skin">The Standard <span class="code">skin.conf</span></a></em>. With this approach you
        can easily add new plot images, change the titles of images, change the
        units used in the reports, and so on. </p>
      <p>However, if your goal is a specialized application, such as adding
        alarms, RSS feeds, etc., then it would be worth your while to read about
        the internal architecture and how to customize it. </p>
      <p>Most of the guide will cover any weather hardware, but the exact data
        types are specific to the Davis Vantage series. Unless you are using an
        unusual type you are unlikely to run into trouble. </p>
      <p class="warning"><strong>Warning!</strong><br />
        <span class="code">weewx</span> is still an experimental system and, as
        such, its internal design is subject to change. Future upgrades may
        break any customizations you have done, particularly if they involve
        the API (skin customizations tend to be more stable). </p>

    <h2>Where to put customizations</h2>
      <p>For configuration changes, simply modify the
        <span class="code">weewx</span> configuration file
        <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, and possibly modify the
        skin configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span> as
        described later in this document.  These files and template files
        in the <span class='code'>skins</span> directory will be preserved
        when you upgrade.</p>
      <p>Other customizations require new Python code or modifications of
        example code. Where should you put the code? If you simply modify
        the examples in place, then your changes will be overwritten the
        next time you do an upgrade.</p>
      <p>A better idea is to put the code in the
        <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/user</span>,
        directory. For example, copy example code from the
        <span class="code">examples</span> directory to the
        <span class="code">user</span> directory, then modify it
        there.  If your modification does not contain much code,
        consider putting it in the
        file <span class="code">extensions.py</span> in the
        <span class="code">user</span> directory.  Because
        the <span class="code">user</span> directory is preserved
        through upgrades, you won't have to redo any changes you might
        have made.</p>

      <h2>Overview of the weewx architecture</h2>
      <p>At a high-level, <span class="code">weewx</span> consists of an engine
        class called <span class="code">StdEngine</span>. It is responsible for
        loading <em>services</em>, then arranging for them to be called when
        key events occur, such as the arrival of LOOP data. The default install
        of <span class="code">weewx</span> includes the following services: </p>

              can be added easily by the user.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>It is easy to extend old services or to add new ones. The source
        distribution includes an example new service called <span class="code">MyAlarm</span>,
        which sends an email when an arbitrary expression evaluates <span class="code">True</span>.
        These advanced topics are covered later in the section <em><a href="#service_engine">Customizing
            the weewx service engine</a></em>. </p>


      <h2>The standard reporting service, <span class="code">StdReport</span></h2>
      <p>For the moment, let us focus on the last service, <span class="code">weewx.engine.StdReport</span>,
        the standard service for creating reports. This will be what most users
        will want to customize, even if it means just changing a few options. </p>
      <h3>Reports</h3>
      <p>The Standard Report Service runs zero or more <em>Reports</em>. The
        specific reports which get run are set in the configuration file <span
          class="code">weewx.conf</span>, in section <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The default distribution of <span class="code">weewx</span> includes
        three reports: </p>
      <table class="indent" summary="Standard reports included in weewx">

            <td>Generates day, week, month and year "to-date" summaries in HTML,
              as well as the plot images to go along with them. Also generates
              NOAA monthly and yearly summaries. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">FTP</td>
            <td>Arranges to upload everything in the <span class="symcode">$HTML_ROOT</span>
              directory up to a remote webserver.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">RSYNC</td>
            <td>Like FTP, but uses rsync for transferring files to a remote
              webserver.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note that the FTP and RSYNC "reports" are a funny kind of report in
        that it they do not actually generate anything. Instead, they use the
        reporting service engine to arrange for things to be transferred to a
        remote server. </p>

      <h3>Skins</h3>
      <p>Each report has a <em>skin</em> associated with it. For most reports,
        the relationship with the skin is an obvious one: it contains the
        templates, any auxiliary files such as background GIFs or CSS style
        sheets, and a <em>skin configuration file</em>, <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
        If you will, the skin controls the <em>look and feel </em>of the
        report. Note that more than one report can use the same skin. For
        example, you might want to run a report that uses US Customary units,
        then run another report against the same skin, but using metric units
        and put the results in a different place. All this is possible by either
        overriding configuration options in the <span class="code">weewx</span>
        configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> or the skin
        configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. </p>
      <p>Like all reports, the FTP and RSYNC "Reports" also use a skin, and
        include a skin configuration file, although they are quite minimal. </p>
      <p>Skins live in their own directory located in <a href="#" id="skin-root-description-target">
          <span class="symcode">$SKIN_ROOT</span></a>.
      </p>

      <div id="skin-root-description" title="$SKIN_ROOT" style="display:none"><p>The symbol <span class='code'>
          $SKIN_ROOT</span> is a symbolic name to the location of the directory where
          your skins are located. It is not to be taken literally. Consult the
          <a href="usersguide.htm#dir-layout-table">directory layout table</a> in 
          the User's Guide for its exact location, dependent
          on how you installed weewx and what operating system you are using</p></div>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        $("#skin-root-description-target").click(
          function () {
            $("#skin-root-description").dialog({position: {my:"left top", at:"right bottom", of: "#skin-root-description-target"}});
            return false; // Insures that the "link" isn't followed
        });
      </script>

      <h3>Generators</h3>
    <p>
      To create their output, skins rely on one or more <em>Generators</em>,
      which are what do the actual work, such as creating HTML
      files or plot images. Generators can also copy files around or
      FTP/rsync them to remote locations. The default install of <span
        class="code">weewx</span> includes the following generators:
    </p>
    <table class="indent" summary="Generators included in weewx">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="first_row">
            <td>Generator</td>
            <td>Function</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</td>
            <td>Generates files from templates, using the Cheetah template engine. Used to generate HTML and text
              files.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">weewx.imagegenerator.ImageGenerator</td>
            <td>Generates graph plots.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">weewx.reportengine.FtpGenerator</td>
            <td>Uploads data to a remote server using FTP.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">weewx.reportengine.RsyncGenerator</td>
            <td>Uploads data to a remote server using rsync.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</td>
            <td>Copies files locally.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note that the three generators <span class="code">FtpGenerator</span>,
        <span class="code">RsyncGenerator</span>, and <span class="code">CopyGenerator</span>
        do not actually generate anything having to do with the presentation
        layer. Instead, they just move files around. </p>
      <p>Which generators are to be run for a given skin is specified in the
        skin's configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, in
        section <a href="#generators_section"><span class="code">[Generators]</span></a>.</p>

    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <p>
      A template is a text file that is processed by a <em>template engine</em>
      to create a new file. <span class="code">Weewx</span>
      uses the <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org">Cheetah</a>
      template engine. The generator <span class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</span>
      is responsible for running Cheetah at appropriate times.
    </p>
    <p>A template may be used to generate HTML, XML, CSV,
      Javascript, or any other type of text file. A template typically
      contains variables that are replaced when creating the new file.
      Templates may also contain simple programming logic.</p>
    <p>
      Each template file lives in the skin directory of the skin that
      uses it. By convention, a template file ends with the <span
        class="code">.tmpl</span> extension.
    </p>

      <h2 id="wee_reports">The tool wee_reports</h2>
      <p>If you make changes, how do you know what the results will look like?
        You could just run weewx and wait until the next reporting cycle kicks
        off but, depending on your archive interval, that could be a 30 minute
        wait or more.</p>
      <p>The tool <span class="code">wee_reports</span> allows you to run a
        report whenever you like. To use it, just run it from a command line,
        with the location of your configuration file
        <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> as the first argument. Optionally,
        if you include a unix epoch timestamp as a second argument, then the
        report will use that as the "Current" time; otherwise, the time of the
        last record in the archive database will be used. Here is an example,
        using 1 May 2014 00:00 PDT as the "Current" time. NB: this example
        assumes you used the <span class="code">setup.py</span> install
        method. Adjust paths as necessary if you used another method.</p>
      <pre class="tty">cd /home/weewx
./bin/wee_reports weewx.conf 1398927600</pre>
    
    <h2>The database</h2>
    <p>
      <span class='code'>Weewx</span> uses a single database to store and retrieve the records it needs.
      It can be implemented by using either
      <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLITE3</a>,
      an open-source, lightweight SQL database, or
      <a href="http://www.mysql.com/"> MySQL</a>, an open-source,
      full-featured database server.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are familiar with the old, Version 2.X data architecture, you may find this white paper <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzuCPu7MsV3Rc3J6GbaMVxtrQ6z5F-xz0glvg3sUWjA/edit?usp=sharing"><i>V3 Database architecture</i></a> useful.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Inside this database are several tables. The most important is the
      <em>archive table</em>, a big flat table, holding one record for each
      archive interval, keyed by <span class="code">dateTime</span>, the
      time at the end of the archive interval. It looks something like this:
    </p>
    <table class="indent" style="text-align:right">

        <td class="first_col"><span class="code">usUnits</span></td>
        <td>The unit system the record is in. It cannot be null. See the
          <em><a href="#units">Appendix: Units</a></em> for how these

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      In addition to the main archive table, there are a number of
      smaller tables inside the database, one for each observation type,
      that hold <em>daily summaries</em> of the type. For example, the
      minimum and maximum value seen during the day, and at what time.
      These tables have names such as <span class="code">archive_day_outTemp</span>
      or <span class="code">archive_day_barometer</span>. Their existence
      is generally transparent to the user.
    </p>

    <h3 id="binding_names">Binding names</h3>
    <p>
      While most users will only need the one weather database that comes with <span
        class="code">weewx</span>, the reporting engine allows you to use
      multiple databases in the same report. For example, if you have installed
      the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/weewx/wiki/monitor/"><span
        class="code">cmon</span></a> computer monitoring package, which uses its own
      database, you may want to include some statistics or graphs about your
      server in your reports, using that database.
    </p>
    <p>
      An additional complication is that <span class="code">weewx</span> can use
      more than one database implementation: SQLite or MySQL. Making
      users specify in the templates not only which database to use,
      but also which implementation, would be unreasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution, like so many other problems in computer science, is to introduce
      another level of indirection, a <em>database binding</em>. Rather than
      specify which database to use, you specify which <em>binding</em> to use.
      Bindings do not change with the database implementation, so, for example,
      you know that <span class="code">wx_binding</span> will always point to
      the weather database. Bindings are listed in section <a
        href="usersguide.htm#DataBindings"><span class="code">[DataBindings]</span></a>
      in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard weather database binding that <span class="code">weewx</span>
      uses is <span class="code">wx_binding</span>. This is the binding that you
      will be using most of the time and, indeed, it is the default. You rarely
      have to specify it explicitly.
    </p>

    <h3>Programming interface</h3>
    <p><span class='code'>weewx</span> includes a module called
      <span class='code'>weedb</span> that provides a single interface for
      many of the differences between database implementations such as SQLite
      and MySQL.  However, it is not uncommon to make direct SQL queries
      within services or search list extensions.  In such cases, the SQL
      should be generic so that it will work with every type of database.</p>
    <p>The database manager class provides methods to create, open, and
      query a database.  These are the canonical forms for obtaining a
      database manager.</p>
    <p>If you are opening a database from within a weewx service:</p>
    <pre class='tty'>db_manager = self.engine.db_binder.get_manager(data_binding='name_of_binding', initialize=True)

# Sample query:
db_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(rain) FROM %s "\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % db_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))</pre>
    <p>If you are opening a database from within a weewx search list extension:</p>
    <pre class='tty'>db_manager = self.generator.db_binder.get_manager(data_binding='name_of_binding')

# Sample query:
db_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(rain) FROM %s "\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % db_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))</pre>
    <p>If opening a database from somewhere other than a service, and there
      is no DBBinder available:</p>
    <pre class='tty'>db_manager = weewx.manager.open_manager_with_config(config_dict, data_binding='name_of_binding', initialize=)

# Sample query:
db_manager.getSql("SELECT SUM(rain) FROM %s "\
    "WHERE dateTime&gt;? AND dateTime&lt;=?" % db_manager.table_name, (start_ts, stop_ts))</pre>
    <p>The DBBinder caches managers, and thus database connections. It cannot
    be shared between threads.</p>

    <h2>Units</h2>
    <p>The unit architecture in <span class='code'>weewx</span> is designed to
      make basic unit conversions and display of units easy.  It is not
      designed to provide dimensional analysis, arbitrary conversions, and
      indications of compatibility.</p>
    <p>The <i>driver</i> reads observations from an instrument and converts
      them, as necessary, into a standard set of units.  The actual units
      used by each instrument vary widely; some instruments use Metric
      units, others use US Customary units, and many use a mixture.  The
      driver ensures that the units are consistent for storage in the
      <span class='code'>weewx</span> database.  By default, and to maintain
      compatibility with <span class='code'>wview</span>, the database
      units are US Customary.</p>
    <p>Much of the <span class='code'>weewx</span> unit architecture is focused
      on presenting data with the appropriate units.  Although the units of the
      data in the database are US Customary, they can be displayed in any
      combination of unit systems.</p>
    <p>Each <i>observation type</i> such as <span class='code'>outTemp</span> 
      or <span class='code'>pressure</span> may be associated with a
      <i>unit group</i> such as <span class='code'>group_temperature</span> or
      <span class='code'>group_pressure</span>.  Each
      unit group is associated with a <i>unit type</i> such
      as <span class='code'>degree_F</span> or
      <span class='code'>mbar</span>.  The
      <a href="#customizing_templates">template system</a>
      uses this architecture to display the names of units and to convert
      observations from one unit to another.</p>
    <p>With this architecture one can easily create reports with, say, wind
      measured in knots, rain measured in mm, and temperatures in degree
      Celsius.  Or one can create a single set of templates, but display
      data in different unit systems with only a few stanzas in a configuration
      file.</p>

      <h1 id="customizing_reports">Customizing reports</h1>
      <p>This section discusses the two general strategies for customizing
        reports: by changing options in one or more configuration file, or by
        changing the template files. The former is generally easier, but
        occasionally the latter is necessary. </p>
      <h2>Changing options</h2>
      <p>Changing an option means either modifying the main configuration file
        <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>, or the skin configuration file
        <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.</p>
      <p>Each skin will have a <span class="code">skin.conf</span> that defines
        its default configuration.  The examples in this guide refer to the
        standard skin that comes with the distribution.</p>
    <h3>
      Changing options in <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
    </h3>
    <p>
      With this approach, edit the skin configuration file with a text
      editor. Changes made in this way will be used by <span
        class="code">weewx</span> the next time it generates reports,
      which is typically the next archive interval; there is no need to
      restart <span class="code">weewx</span> to see the results of the
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the standard skin that comes with <span class="code">weewx</span>,
      the file is <span class="symcode">$SKIN_ROOT</span><span
        class="code">/Standard/skin.conf</span>. It includes many, many
      options that can be changed. For a complete list, see the section
      <em><a href="#standard_skin">The Standard <span class="code">skin.conf</span></a></em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose you wish to use metric units in the
      presentation layer, instead of the default US Customary Units. The
      section that controls units is <span class="code">[Units][[Groups]]</span>.
      It looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Groups]]
        group_altitude    = foot
        group_degree_day  = degree_F_day 
        group_direction   = degree_compass
        group_moisture    = centibar
        group_percent     = percent
        group_pressure    = inHg
        group_radiation   = watt_per_meter_squared
        group_rain        = inch
        group_rainrate    = inch_per_hour
        group_speed       = mile_per_second
        group_speed2      = mile_per_second2
        group_temperature = degree_F
        group_uv          = uv_index 
        group_volt        = volt</pre>
      <p>To use metric units, you would edit this section to read: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Groups]]
        <span class="highlight">group_altitude    = meter</span>
        <span class="highlight">group_degree_day  = degree_C_day</span>
        group_direction   = degree_compass
        group_moisture    = centibar
        group_percent     = percent
        <span class="highlight">group_pressure    = mbar</span>
        group_radiation   = watt_per_meter_squared
        <span class="highlight">group_rain        = mm</span>
        <span class="highlight">group_rainrate    = mm_per_hour</span>
        <span class="highlight">group_speed       = meter_per_second</span>
        <span class="highlight">group_speed2      = meter_per_second2</span>
        <span class="highlight">group_temperature = degree_C</span>
        group_uv          = uv_index 
        group_volt        = volt</pre>
      <p>The options that were changed have been <span class="highlight">&nbsp;highlighted&nbsp;</span>.
        Details of the various unit options are given in the
        <em><a href="#units">Appendix: Units</a></em>.</p>
      <p>Other options are available, such as changing the text label for
        various observation types. For example, suppose your weather console is
        actually located in a barn, not indoors, and you want the plot for the
        temperature at the console to be labeled "Barn Temperature," rather than
        the default "Inside Temperature." This can be done by changing the <span
          class="code">inTemp</span> option located in section <span class="code">[Labels][[Generic]]</span>
        from the default </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Generic]]
        inTemp  = Inside Temperature
        outTemp = Outside Temperature
        ...</pre>
      <p>to: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Units]
    [[Generic]]
        <span class="highlight">inTemp  = Barn Temperature</span>
        outTemp = Outside Temperature
        ...</pre>
      <h3>Overriding options in <span class="code">skin.conf</span> from <span
          class="code">weewx.conf</span></h3>
      <p>This approach is very similar, except that instead of changing the
        skin configuration file directly, you override its options by editing
        the main configuration file, <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. The
        advantage of this approach is that you can use the same skin to produce
        several different output, each with separate options.</p>
      <p>With this approach, you must restart <span class="code">weewx</span>
        to see the effects of any changes.</p>
      <p>Revisiting our example, suppose you want two reports, one in US
        Customary, the other in Metric. The former will go in the directory
        <span class="symcode"> $HTML_ROOT</span>, the latter in a directory,
        <span class="symcode"> $HTML_ROOT</span><span class="code">/metric</span>.
        If you just simply modify <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, you can
        get one, but not both at the same time. Alternatively, you could create
        a whole new skin by copying all the files to a new skin directory
        then editing the new <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. The trouble
        with this approach is that you would then have <em>two</em> skins you
        would have to maintain. If you change something, you have to remember to
        change it in both places. </p>
      <p>But, there's a better approach: reuse the same skin, but override some
        of its options. Here is what your <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>
        section in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> would look like: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[StdReport]
    #
    # This section specifies what reports, using which skins, are to be generated.
    #

    # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
    SKIN_ROOT = skins

    # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
    HTML_ROOT = public_html

    # This report will use US Customary Units
    [[USReport]]
        # It is based on the Standard skin
        skin = Standard

    # This report will use metric units:
    [[MetricReport]]
        # It is also based on the Standard skin:
        skin = Standard 
        # However, override where the results will go and put them in a directory:
        HTML_ROOT = public_html/metric
    
        # And override the options that were not in metric units
        [[[Units]]]
            [[[[Groups]]]]
                group_altitude    = meter
                group_pressure    = mbar
                group_rain        = mm
                group_rainrate    = mm_per_hour
                group_speed       = meter_per_second
                group_speed2      = meter_per_second2
                group_temperature = degree_C
</pre>
      <p>We have done two things different from the stock reports. First (1),
        we have renamed the first report from <span class="code">StandardReport</span> to
        <span class="code">USReport</span> for clarity; and second (2), we have
        introduced a new report <span class="code">MetricReport</span>, just
        like the first, except it puts its results in a different spot and uses
        different units. Both use the same skin, the <span class="code">Standard</span> 
        skin.</p>
      <h2 id="customizing_templates">Customizing templates</h2>
      <p>If you cannot achieve the results you need by changing a configuration
        option, you may have to modify the templates that come with <span class="code">weewx</span>,
        or write your own. </p>
      <p>Template modifications are preserved across upgrades (indeed,
        everything in the <span class="code">skins</span> directory is
        preserved), so you don't have to worry about losing changes after an upgrade.</p>
      <p>Template generation is done using the <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>
        templating engine. This is a very powerful engine, which essentially
        lets you have the full semantics of Python available in your templates.
        As this would make the templates incomprehensible to anyone but a Python
        programmer, <span class="code">weewx</span> adopts a very small subset
        of its power. </p>

      <h3>The dot code</h3>
      <p>The key construct is a 'dot' code, specifying what value you want. For
        example: </p>
      <pre class="tty">$month.outTemp.max
$month.outTemp.maxtime
$current.outTemp</pre>
      <p>would code the max outside temperature for the month, the time it
        occurred, and the current outside temperature, respectively. So a
        template file that contains:</p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Current conditions&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Current temperature = $current.outTemp&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max for the month is $month.outTemp.max, which occurred at $month.outTemp.maxtime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
      <p>would be all you need for a very simple HTML page that would display
        the text (assuming that the unit group for temperature is <span class="code">degree_F</span>):
        </p>
      <p class="example_output">Current temperature = 51.0°F <br />
        Max for the month is 68.8°F, which occurred at 07-Oct-2009 15:15 </p>
      <p>The format that was used to format the temperature (<span class="code">51.0</span>)
        is specified in section <span class="code"><a href="#Units_StringFormats">[Units][[StringFormat]]</a></span>.
        The unit label <span class="code">°F</span> is from section <span class="code"><a
            href="#Units_Labels">[Units][[Labels]]</a></span>, while the time
        format is from <span class="code"><a href="#Units_TimeFormats">[Units][[TimeFormats]]</a></span>.
      </p>
      <p>As we saw above, the dot codes can be very simple: </p>
      <pre class="tty">## Output max outside temperature using an appropriate format and label:
$month.outTemp.max</pre>
      <p>Most of the time, the dot code will "do the right thing" and is all you
        will need. However, <span class="code">weewx</span> offers extensive
        customization of the generated output for specialized applications such
        as XML RSS feeds, or ridgidly formatted reports (such as the NOAA
        reports). This section specifies the various options available. </p>
      <p>There are two different versions of the dot code, depending on whether
        the data is "current", or an aggregation over time. However, both
        versions are similar.</p>

      <h3>Time period <span class="code">$current</span></h3>
      <p>Time period <span class="code">$current</span> represents a
        <em>current observation</em>. An example would be the current
        barometric pressure:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">$current.barometer</pre>
      <p>The most general dot code for a "current" observation looks like: </p>
      <pre class="tty">$current($data_binding=<em>binding_name</em>).<em>obstype</em>[.<em>optional_unit_conversion</em>][.<em>optional_formatting</em>]</pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="code">binding_name</span> is a <em>binding name</em>
      to a database. An example would be <span class="code">wx_binding</span>.
      See the section <em><a href="#binding_names">Binding names</a></em>
      for more details.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="code">obstype</span> is an observation type, such as
      <span class="code">barometer</span>. See

      specified units, otherwise the default units specified in the skin
      configuration file (in section <span class="code">[Units][[Groups]]</span>)
      will be used. See the section
      <em><a href="#unit_conversion_options">Unit Conversion Options</a></em>.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="code">optional_formatting</span> is an optional
      formatting tag that controls how the value will appear. See the section
      <em><a href="#formatting_options">Formatting Options</a></em>.
    </p>

      <h3>Time period <span class="code">$latest</span></h3>
      <p>Time period <span class="code">$latest</span> is very similar
      to <span class="code">$current</span>, except that it uses
      the last available timestamp in a database. Usually, 
      <span class="code">$current</span> and <span class="code">$latest</span> are the same,
      but if a data binding points to a remote database, they may not be. See
      the section <em><a href="#stupid_detail">Using multiple bindings</a></em>
      for an example where this happened.</p> 

    <h3 id="general_aggregation_periods">Aggregation periods</h3>

    <p>A dot code such as</p> 
    <pre class="tty">$week.rain.sum</pre>
    <p>represents an <em>aggregation over time</em>, using a certain <em>aggregation type</em>. 
    In this example, the aggregation time is a week, and the aggregation type is summation.
    So, this tag represents the total rainfall over a week.
    </p>
    <p>The most general dot code for an aggregation over time looks like:</p>
    <pre class="tty">$<em>period</em>($data_binding=<em>binding_name</em>).<em>statstype</em>.<em>aggregation</em>[.<em>optional_unit_conversion</em>][.<em>optional_formatting</em>]</pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="code">period</span> is the time period over which
      the aggregation is to be done. Possible choices are listed in a table below.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="code">binding_name</span> is a <em>binding name</em>
      to a database. An example would be <span class="code">wx_binding</span>.

    <p class="indent">
      <span class="code">aggregation</span> is an <em>aggregation type</em>.

      <p>The tag <span class="code">optional_unit_conversion</span>
        can be used with either current observations or aggregations. If
        supplied, the results will be converted to the specified units. For
        example, if you have set <span class="code">group_pressure</span> to
        inches of mercury (<span class="code">inHg</span>), then the tag </p>
      <pre class="tty">Today's average pressure=$day.barometer.avg </pre>
      <p>would normally give a result such as </p>
      <p class="example_output">Today's average pressure=30.05 inHg </p>
      <p>However, if you add <span class="code">mbar</span> to the end, </p>
      <pre class="tty">$day.barometer.avg.mbar </pre>
      <p>then the results will be in millibars: </p>
      <p class="example_output">Today's average pressure=1017.5 mbar </p>
      <h4>Wind ordinals</h4>
      <p>Using this method, you can output compass ordinals for wind direction.
        For example, the template</p>
      <pre class="tty">Current wind direction is $current.windDir ($current.windDir.ordinal_compass)</pre>
      <p>would result in:</p>
      <p class="example_output">Current wind direction is 138° (SW)</p>
      <p>The ordinal abbreviations are set by option <span class="code">directions</span>
        in the skin configuration file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.</p>
      <h4>Illegal conversions</h4>
      <p>If an inappropriate or nonsense conversion is asked for, <em>e.g.</em>, </p>
      <pre class="tty">Today's minimum pressure in mbars: $day.barometer.min.mbar
or in degrees C: $day.barometer.min.degree_C
or in foobar units: $day.barometer.min.foobar
</pre>
      <p>then the offending tag(s) will be put in the output: </p>
      <p class="example_output">Today's minimum pressure in mbars: 1015.3<br/>
or in degrees C: $day.barometer.min.degree_C<br/>
or in foobar units: $day.barometer.min.foobar

      <p>Tags that take an argument, such as
        <span class="code">.string(NONE_string)</span>, do not require
        parenthesis if the argument is omitted. Thus, you can specify either
        <span class="code">$month.outTemp.string()</span> or
        <span class="code">$month.outTemp.string</span>, if you want the
        default value of <span class="code">NONE_string</span>. They produce
        the same results.</p>

      <h3>Type <span class="code">dateTime</span></h3>
      <p>While not an observation type, in many ways the time of an observation,
        <span class="code">dateTime</span>, can be treated as one. A tag such as
        <span class="code">$current.dateTime</span> represents the <em>current
          time</em> (more properly, the time as of the end of the last archive
        interval). Similarly, a tag such as <span class="code">$month.dateTime</span>
        represents the start time of the month. Like true observation types,
        explicit formats can be specified, except that they require a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior">
          strftime() <em>time format</em></a>, rather than a <em>string
          format</em>.</p>
      <p>  For example, </p>
      <pre class="tty">$month.dateTime.format("%B %Y")</pre>
      <p>produces </p>
      <p class="example_output">January 2010</p>
      <p>The returned string value will always be in <em>local time</em>. </p>
      <p>The raw value of <span class="code">dateTime</span> is Unix Epoch Time
        (number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC 1 Jan 1970, <em>i.e.</em>, a
        large number), which you must convert yourself to local time. It is
        guaranteed to never be <span class="code">None</span>, so you don't
        worry have to worry about handling a <span class="code">None</span>
        value. </p>

      <h3>Tag <span class="code">$trend</span></h3>
      <p>The tag <span class="code">$trend</span> is available for time trends,
        such as barometer trends. Here are some examples:</p>
      <table class="indent" style="width: 50%" summary="Examples of using unit formats">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="first_row">
            <td>Tag</td>
            <td>Results</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$trend.barometer</td>
            <td class="code">-.05 inHg</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$trend($time_delta=3600).barometer</td>
            <td class="code">-.02 inHg</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$trend.outTemp</td>
            <td class="code">1.1 °C</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$trend.time_delta</td>
            <td class="code">10800 secs</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$trend.time_delta.hour</td>
            <td class="code">3 hrs</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    <p>
      Not how you can explicitly specify a value in the tag itself (2nd example
      above). If you do not specify a value, then a default time
      interval, set by option <span class="code"><a href="#trend">time_delta</a></span>
      in the skin configuration file, will be used. This value can be retrieved
      by using the syntax <span class="code">$trend.time_delta</span> (3rd
      example above).
    </p>
    <p>For example, the template expression</p>
      <pre class="tty">The barometer trend over $trend.time_delta.hour is $trend.barometer.format("%+.2f")</pre>
    <p>would result in</p>
    <p class="example_output">The barometer trend over 3 hrs is +.03 inHg.</p>

    <h3>Tag <span class="code">$unit</span></h3>
      <p>The unit type, label, and string formats are also available, allowing
        you to do highly customized labels: </p>
      <table class="indent" style="width: 50%" summary="Examples of using unit formats">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="first_row">
            <td>Tag</td>
            <td>Results</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$unit.unit_type.outTemp</td>
            <td class="code">degree_C</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$unit.label.outTemp</td>
            <td class="code">°C</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">$unit.format.outTemp</td>
            <td class="code">%.1f</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>For example, the tag </p>
      <pre class="tty">$day.outTemp.max.formatted$unit.label.outTemp</pre>
      <p>would result in </p>
      <p class="example_output">21.2°C</p>
      <p>(assuming metric values have been specified for <span class="code">group_temperature</span>),
        essentially reproducing the results of the simpler tag <span class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span>.
      </p>
      <h3>Iteration</h3>
      <p>For dot codes using an aggregation <em>e.g.</em>,
        <span class="code">$day</span>, <span class="code">$week</span>,
        <span class="code">$month</span>, <span class="code">$year</span>,
        <span class="code">$rainyear</span>, then
        the aggregation period can be iterated over. </p>
      <p>For example, the following template uses a Cheetah
        <span class="code">for</span> loop to iterate over all months in
        a year, printing out each month's min and max temperature.  The
        iteration loop is
        <span class="highlight">&nbsp;highlighted&nbsp;</span>.</p>
      <pre class="tty">Min, max temperatures by month
<span class="highlight">#for $month in $year.months</span>
$month.dateTime.format("%B"): Min, max temperatures: $month.outTemp.min $month.outTemp.max
<span class="highlight">#end for</span></pre>
      <p>The result is:</p>
      <p class="example_output">Min, max temperatures by month:<br/>
January: Min, max temperatures: 30.1°F 51.5°F<br/>
February: Min, max temperatures: 24.4°F 58.6°F<br/>
March: Min, max temperatures: 27.3°F 64.1°F<br/>
April: Min, max temperatures: 33.2°F 52.5°F<br/>
May: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
June: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
July: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
August: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
September: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
October: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
November: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A<br/>
December: Min, max temperatures: N/A N/A</p>
      <p>See the NOAA template files <span class="code">NOAA/NOAA-YYYY.txt.tmpl</span>
        and <span class="code">NOAA/NOAA-YYYY-MM.txt.tmpl</span> for examples
        using iteration, as well as explicit formatting. </p>
      <h3>Almanac</h3>
      <p>If module <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem">pyephem</a> has been
        installed, then <span class="code">weewx</span> can generate extensive
        almanac information for the Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and other
        heavenly bodies, including their rise, transit and set times, as well as
        their azimuth and altitude. Other information is also available. </p>
      <p>Here is an example template:</p>
      <p class="tty">Current time is $current.dateTime
#if $almanac.hasExtras
Sunrise, transit, sunset: $almanac.sun.rise $almanac.sun.transit $almanac.sun.set
Moonrise, transit, moonset: $almanac.moon.rise $almanac.moon.transit $almanac.moon.set
Mars rise, transit, set: $almanac.mars.rise $almanac.mars.transit $almanac.mars.set
Azimuth, altitude of mars: $almanac.mars.az $almanac.mars.alt
Next new, full moon: $almanac.next_new_moon $almanac.next_full_moon
Next summer, winter solstice: $almanac.next_summer_solstice $almanac.next_winter_solstice
#else
Sunrise, sunset: $almanac.sunrise $almanac.sunset
#end if</p>
      <p>If pyephem is installed this would result in: </p>
      <p class="example_output">Current time is 29-Mar-2011 09:20<br/>
Sunrise, transit, sunset: 06:51 13:11 19:30<br/>
Moonrise, transit, moonset: 04:33 09:44 15:04<br/>
Mars rise, transit, set: 06:35 12:30 18:26<br/>
Azimuth, altitude of mars: 124.354959275 26.4808431952<br/>
Next new, full moon: 03-Apr-2011 07:32 17-Apr-2011 19:43<br/>
Next summer, winter solstice: 21-Jun-2011 10:16 21-Dec-2011 21:29</p>
      <p>Otherwise, a fallback of basic calculations is used, resulting in:</p>
      <p class="example_output">Current time is 29-Mar-2011 09:20<br/>
Sunrise, sunset: 06:51 19:30</p>
      <p>As shown in the example, you can test whether this extended almanac
        information is available with the value <span class="code">$almanac.hasExtras</span>.
      </p>
      <p>The almanac information falls in two categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calendar events</li>
        <li>Heavenly bodies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will cover each of these separately.</p>
      <h4>Calendar events</h4>
      <p>"Calendar events" do not require a heavenly body. They cover things
        such as <span class="code">next_solstice</span>, or <span class="code">next_first_quarter_moon</span>.
        The syntax here is </p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.next_solstice</pre>
      <p>or </p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.next_first_quarter_moon</pre>
      <p>Here is a table of the information that falls into this category:</p>
      <table class="indent" style="width:60%">
        <caption>Calendar events</caption>
        <tbody class="code">
          <tr>
            <td>previous_equinox</td>
            <td>next_equinox</td>
            <td>previous_solstice</td>
            <td>next_solstice</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_autumnal_equinox</td>
            <td>next_autumnal_equinox</td>
            <td>previous_vernal_equinox</td>
            <td>next_vernal_equinox</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_winter_solstice</td>
            <td>next_winter_solstice</td>
            <td>previous_summer_solstice</td>
            <td>next_summer_solstice</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_new_moon</td>
            <td>next_new_moon</td>
            <td>previous_first_quarter_moon</td>
            <td>next_first_quarter_moon</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>previous_full_moon</td>
            <td>next_full_moon</td>
            <td>previous_last_quarter_moon</td>
            <td>next_last_quarter_moon</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h4>Heavenly bodies</h4>
      <p>The second category does require a heavenly body. This covers queries
        such as, "When does Jupiter rise?" or, "When does the sun transit?"
        Examples are</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.jupiter.rise</pre>
      <p>or</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.sun.transit</pre>
      <p>To accurately calculate these times, <span class="code">weewx</span>
        automatically uses the present temperature and pressure to calculate
        refraction effects. However, you can override these values, which will
        be necessary if you wish to match the almanac times published by the
        Naval Observatory <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/rise-set.html">as
          explained in the pyephem documentation</a>. For example, to match the
        sunrise time as published by the Observatory, instead of</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac.sun.rise</pre>
      <p>use</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=0, horizon=-34.0/60.0).sun.rise</pre>
      <p>By setting pressure to zero we are bypassing the refraction
        calculations and manually setting the horizon to be 34 arcminutes lower
        than the normal horizon. This is what the Navy uses.</p>
      <p>If you wish to calculate the start of civil twilight, you can set the
        horizon to -6 degrees, and also tell <span class="code">weewx</span> to
        use the center of the sun (instead of the upper limb, which it normally
        uses) to do the calcuation:</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=0, horizon=-6).sun(use_center=1).rise</pre>
      <p>The general syntax is:</p>
      <pre class="tty">$almanac(pressure=<em>pressure</em>, horizon=<em>horizon</em>,
         temperature=<em>temperature_C</em>).<em>heavenly_body</em>(use_center=[01]).<em>attribute</em></pre>
      <p>As you can see, in addition to the horizon angle, you can also override
        atmospheric pressure and temperature (degrees Celsius).</p>
      <p>PyEphem offers an extensive list of objects that can be used for the <span
          class="code"><em>heavenly_body</em></span> tag. All the planets and
        many stars are in the list.</p>
      <p>The possible values for the <span class="code">attribute</span> tag
        are listed in the following table:</p>
      <table class="indent" style="width: 80%">
        <caption>Attributes that can be used with heavenly bodies</caption>

    <h3>Wind</h3>
    <p>
      Wind deserves a few comments because it is stored in the database in two
      different ways: as a set of scalars, and as a <em>vector</em> of speed and
      direction. Here are the four wind-related scalars stored in the main archive
      database:
    </p>
    <table class="indent">

        <tr>

    <h2 id="defining_new_tags">Defining new tags</h2>

      <p>
        We have seen how you can change a template and
        make use of the various tags available such as <span
          class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span> for the maximum outside
        temperature for the day. But, what if you want to introduce some
        new data for which no tag is available?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to introduce a static tag, that is, one that will
        not change with time (such as a Google analytics Tracker ID, or
        your name), then this is very easy: simply put it in section <span
          class="code"><a href="#Extras">[Extras]</a></span> in the skin
        configuration file. More information on how to do this can be
        found there.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, what if you wish to introduce a more dynamic tag, one that
        requires some calculation, or perhaps uses the database? Simply
        putting it in the <span class="code">[Extras]</span> section
        won't do, because then it cannot change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is to write a <em>search list extension</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>How the search list works</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start by taking a look at how the Cheetah <em>search list</em>
        works.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cheetah template engine finds tags by scanning a search list, a Python
        list of objects. For example, for a tag <span class="code">$foo</span>,
        the engine will scan down the list, trying each object in the
        list in turn. For each object, it will first try using <span
          class="code">foo</span> as an attribute, that is, it will try
        evaluating <span class="code"><i>obj</i>.foo</span>. If that
        raises an <span class="code">AttributeError</span> exception,
        then it will try <span class="code">foo</span> as a key, that is
        <span class="code"><i>obj</i>[key]</span>. If that raises a <span
          class="code">KeyError</span> exception, then it moves on to
        the next item in the list. The first match that does not raise
        an exception is used. If no match is found, Cheetah raises a <span
          class="code">NameMapper.NotFound</span> exception.
      </p>

      <h3 id="how_tags_work">How tags work</h3>
      <p>
        Now let's take a look at how the search list interacts with <span
          class="code">weewx</span> tags. Let's start by looking at a
        simple example: station altitude, available as the tag
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">
$station.altitude</pre>

      <p>
        As we saw in the previous section, Cheetah will run down the
        search list, looking for an object with a key or attribute <span
          class="code">station</span>. In the default search list, <span
          class="code">weewx</span> includes one such object, an
        instance of the class <span class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.Station</span>,
        which has an attribute <span class="code">station</span>, so it
        gets a hit on this object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheetah will then try to evaluate the attribute <span
          class="code">altitude</span> on this object. Class <span
          class="code">Station</span> has such an attribute, so Cheetah
        evaluates it.
      </p>

      <p>
        What this attribute returns is not a raw value, say <span
          class="code">700</span>, nor even a string. Instead, it
        returns an instance of the class <span class="code">ValueHelper</span>,
        a special class defined in module <span class="code">weewx.units</span>.
        Internally, it holds not only the raw value, but also references
        to the formats, labels, and conversion targets
        you specified in your configuration file. Its job is to make sure
        that the final output reflects these preferences. Cheetah doesn't know
        anything about this class. What it needs, when it has finished
        evaluating the expression <span class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span>
        is a <em>string</em>. In order to convert the <span class="code">ValueHelper</span>
        it has into a string, it does what every other Python object does when
        faced with this problem: it calls the special method <span
          class="code"><a style="text-decoration: none"
          href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__">__str__</a></span>.
        Class <span class="code">ValueHelper</span> has a definition for
        this method. Evaluating this function triggers the final steps
        in this process. Any necessary unit conversions are done, then
        formatting occurs and, finally, a label is attached. The result
        is a string something like
      </p>
      <p class="example_output">700 feet</p>
      <p>which is what Cheetah actually puts in the generated HTML
        file. This is a good example of <em>lazy evaluation</em>. The
        tags gather all the information they need, but don't do the final
        evaluation until the last final moment, when the most
        context is understood. Weewx uses this technique extensively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's look at a more complicated example, say the maximum temperature since midnight:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">$day.outTemp.max</pre>
    <p>
      When this is evaluated by Cheetah, it actually produces a chain of
      objects. At the top of this chain is class <span class="code">weewx.tags.TimeBinder</span>,
      an instance of which is included in the default search list. Internally,
      this instance stores the time of the desired report (usually the time of
      the last archive record), a cache to the databases, a default data
      binding, as well as references to the formatting and labelling options you
      have chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This instance is examined by Cheetah to see if it has an attribute <span
        class="code">day</span>. It does and, when it is evaluated, it returns
      the next class in the chain, an instance of <span class="code">weewx.tags.TimespanBinder</span>.
      In addition to all the other things contained in its parent <span
        class="code">TimeBinder</span>, class <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span> adds the desired time
      period, that is, the time span from midnight to the current time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheetah then continues on down the chain and tries to find the next
      attribute, <span class="code">outTemp</span>. There is no such hard coded
      attribute (hard coding all the different observation types would be
      impossible!). Instead, class <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span>
      defines the method <span class="code">
        <a style="text-decoration: none"
           href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__">__getattr__</a></span>. Any unknown attribute is passed to this
      special method. It returns an instance of the next class in the chain, <span
        class="code">weewx.tags.ObservationBinder</span>, which not only
      remembers all the previous stuff, but also adds the observation type, <span
        class="code">outTemp</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cheetah then tries to evaluate an attribute <span class="code">max</span>
        of this class. Now, finally, the chain ends. The attribute <span
          class="code">max</span> triggers the actual calculation of the
        value, using all the known parameters: the database binding to be hit,
        the time span of interest, the observation type, and the type of
        aggregation, querying the database as necessary. The database is not
        actually hit until the last possible moment, after everything
        needed to do the evalation is known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like our previous example, the results of the evaluation are then
        packaged up in an instance of <span class="code">ValueHelper</span>,
        which does the final conversion to the desired units, formats
        the string, then adds a label. The results, something like
      </p>
      <p class="example_output">12&deg;C</p>
      <p>
        are put in the generated HTML file. As you can see, a lot of
        machinery is hidden behind the deceptively simple expression <span
          class="code">$day.outTemp.max</span>!
      </p>

      <h3 id="extending_the_list">Extending the list</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned, <span class="code">weewx</span> comes with a
        number of objects already in the search list, but you can extend
        it. To do so, you should have some familiarity with Python, in
        particular, how to write new classes and member functions for
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example. The regular version of <span
          class="code">weewx</span> offers statistical summaries by day,
        week, month, and year. Suppose we would like to add two more:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All-time statistics. This would allow us to display
          statistics such as the all-time high or low temperature seen
          at your station;</li>
        <li>Seven days statistics. While <span class="code">weewx</span>
          offers the tag <span class="code">$week</span>, this is
          statistics <em>since Sunday at midnight</em>. We would like to
          have statistics for a full week, that is since midnight seven
          days ago.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This example is included in the distribution as <span class="symcode">
          $BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/examples/xsearch.py</span>: </p>

      <p>Going through the example, line by line: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new class called <span class="code">MyXSearch</span>,
        which will inherit from class <span class="code">SearchList</span>. All
        search list extensions inherit from this class.
      </li>
      <li>Create an initializer for our new class. In this case, the
        initializer is not really necessary and does nothing except pass its
        only parameter, <span class="code">generator</span>, a reference to the
        calling generator, on to its superclass, <span class="code">SearchList</span>.
        The superclass will store it in <span class="code">self</span>.
      </li>
      <li>Override member function <span class="code">get_extension_list()</span>.
        This function will be called when the generator is ready to accept your
        new search list extension. The parameters that will be passed in are:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="code">self</span> Python's way of indicating the
            instance we are working with;</li>
          <li><span class="code">timespan</span> An instance of the
            utility class <span class="code">TimeSpan</span>. This will contain
            the valid start and ending times used by the template. Normally,
            this is all valid times;</li>
          <li><span class="code">db_lookup</span> This is a function
          supplied by the generator. It takes a single argument, a
          name of a binding. When called, it will return an instance of the database manager
          class for that binding. The default for the function is whatever
          binding you set with the option <span class="code">data_binding</span>
          for this report, usually <span class="code">wx_binding</span>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The class <span class="code">TimespanBinding</span> represents a
        statistical calculation over a time period. We have already met it in
        the introduction <em><a href="#how_tags_work">How tags work</a></em>.
        In our case, we will set it up to represent the statistics over
        all possible times. The class takes 4 parameters.
        <ul>
          <li>The first is the timespan over which the calculation is to be
            done. Here, we have a lucky coincidence: the variable <span
            class="code">timespan</span> already holds a <span
            class="code">TimeSpan</span> object representing the domain of all
            valid timespans, so we simply pass it in.
          </li>
          <li>The second is the database lookup function to be used. We simply pass in 
          <span class="code">db_lookup</span>.
          </li>
          <li>The third should be an instance of class <span class="code">weewx.units.Formatter</span>,
            which contains information about how the results should be
            formatted. We just pass in the formatter set up by the generator, <span
            class="code">self.generator.formatter</span>.
          </li>
          <li>The fourth should be an instance of <span class="code">weewx.units.Converter</span>,
            which contains information about the target units (<em>e.g.</em>, <span
            class="code">degree_C</span>) that are to be used. Again, we just
            pass in the instance set up by the generator, <span class="code">self.generator.converter</span>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>That one was relatively easy because we already had an instance of
        <span class="code">TimeSpan</span>, that is,
        <span class="code">timespan</span>,
        which represented the time over which we wanted to do the calculations.
        Setting up an instance that will work for the last seven days is a bit
        trickier. Continuing our example...</p>
      <ol start="5">
        <li>The object <span class="code">timespan</span> holds the
          domain of all valid times, but in order to calculate statistics for 
          the last seven days, we need not the earliest valid time, but the
          time at midnight seven days ago. So, we do a little Python date
          arithmetic to calculate this. The object
          <span class="code">week_dt</span> will be an instance of
          <span class="code">datetime.date</span>.</li>
        <li>We convert it to unix epoch time.</li>
        <li>Now we are ready to initialize an appropriate
          <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span> object. It's the same as in
          step #4, except we use our new timespan object.</li>
        <li>Create a small dictionary with two keys,
          <span class="code">alltime</span>, and
          <span class="code">seven_day</span>.</li>
        <li>Return the dictionary in a list</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The final step that we need to do is to tell the template engine where to find our 
        extension. You do that by going into the skin configuration file,
        <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, and adding the option
        <span class="code">search_list_extensions</span> with our new
        extension. When you're done, it will look something like this:</p>
      <pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]
    # This section is used by the generator CheetahGenerator, and specifies
    # which files are to be generated from which template.

    # Possible encodings are 'html_entities', 'utf8', or 'strict_ascii'
    encoding = html_entities
    <span class="highlight">search_list_extensions = examples.xsearch.MyXSearch</span>

    [[SummaryByMonth]]
    ...
</pre>
      <p>Our addition has been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>. Note that it is in the section
        <span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>Now, if the Cheetah engine encounters the tag <span class="code">
          $alltime</span>, it will scan the search list, looking for an
        attribute or key that matches <span class="code">alltime</span>. When
        it gets to the little dictionary we provided, it will find a matching
        key, allowing it to retrieve the appropriate
        <span class="code">TimespanBinding</span> object.</p>
      <p>With this approach, you can now include "all time" or "seven day"
        statistics in your HTML templates: </p>
      <pre class="tty">
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Maximum temperature to date: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$alltime.outTemp.max&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Minimum temperature to date: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$alltime.outTemp.min
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Rain over the last seven days: &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;$seven_day.rain.sum
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
      <p>If you place a custom generator somewhere other than the
        <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span> hierarchy where
        <span class="code">weewxd</span> resides, you may have to specify its
        location in the environment variable
        <span class="code">PYTHONPATH</span>
        in the shell where you start weewx:
      </p>
        <pre class="tty">export PYTHONPATH=/home/me/secret_location</pre>


    <h2>Customizing images</h2>
    <p>
      The installed version of <span class="code">weewx</span> is configured to
      generate a set of useful plots. But, what if you don't like how they look,

    chart_background_color = 0xd8d8d8
    chart_gridline_color = 0xa0a0a0
    ...</pre>
    <p>
      The options right under the section name <span class="code">[ImageGenerator]</span>
      will apply to <em>all</em> plots, unless overridden in subsections. So,
      unless otherwise changed, all plots will be 300 pixels in width, 180
      pixels in height, and will have an RGB background color of 0xf5f5f5, a
      very light gray (HTML color "WhiteSmoke"). The chart itself will have a
      background color of 0xd8d8d8 (a little darker gray), and the gridlines
      will be 0xa0a0a0 (still darker). The other options farther (not shown)
      will also apply to all plots.
    </p>

    <h3>Time periods</h3>
    <p>
      After the "global" options at the top of section <span class="code">[ImageGenerator]</span>,
      comes a set of sub-sections, one for each time period (day, week, month,
      and year). These sub-sections define the nature of aggregation and plot
      types for that time period. For example, here is a typical set of options
      for sub-section <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span>. It controls
      which "monthly" images will get generated, and what they will look like:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">    [[month_images]]
        x_label_format = %d
        bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M
        time_length = 2592000    # == 30 days
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 10800    # == 3 hours
        show_daynight = false
</pre>
    <p>
      The option <span class="code">x_label_format</span> gives a <a
        href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-behavior">strftime()</a>
      type format for the x-axis. In this example, it will only show days
      (format option <span class="code">%d</span>). The <span class="code">bottom_label_format</span>
      is the format used to time stamp the image at the bottom. In this example,
      it will show the time as something like<span class="code">10/25/09
        15:35</span>. A plot will cover a nominal 30 days, and all items included in it
      will use an aggregate type of averaging over 3 hours. Finally, by setting
      option <span class="code">show_daynight</span> to <span class="code">false</span>,
      we are requesting that day-night, shaded bands not be shown.
    </p>

    <h3>Image files</h3>
    <p>
      Within each time period sub-section is another nesting, one for each image
      to be generated. The title of each sub-sub-section is the filename to be
      used for the image. Finally, at one additional nesting level (!) are the
      logical names of all the line types to be drawn in the image. Like
      elsewhere, the values specified in the level above can be overridden. For
      example, here is a typical set of options for sub-sub-section <span
        class="code">[[[monthrain]]]</span>:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">        [[[monthrain]]]
            plot_type = bar
            yscale = None, None, 0.02
            [[[[rain]]]]
                aggregate_type = sum
                aggregate_interval = 86400
                label = Rain (daily total)</pre>
    <p>
      This will generate an image file with name <span class="code">monthrain.png</span>.
      It will be a bar plot. Option <span class="code">yscale</span> controls
      the y-axis scaling — if left out, the scale will automatically be chosen.
      However, in this example we are choosing to exercise some degree of
      control by specifying values explicitly. The option is a 3-way tuple (<span
        class="code">ylow</span>, <span class="code">yhigh</span>, <span
        class="code">min_interval</span>), where <span class="code">ylow</span>
      and <span class="code">yhigh</span> are the minimum and maximum y-axis
      values, respectively, and <span class="code">min_interval</span> is the
      minimum tick interval. If set to <span class="code">None</span>, the
      corresponding value will be automatically chosen. So, in this example, the
      setting
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">yscale = None, None, 0.02</pre>
    <p>
      will cause <span class="code">weewx</span> to pick sensible y minimum and
      maximum values, but require that the tick increment (<span class="code">min_interval</span>)
      be at least 0.02.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing on with the example above, there will be only one plot "line"
      (it will actually be a series of bars) and it will have logical name <span
        class="code">rain</span>. Because we have not said otherwise, the SQL
      data type to be used for this line will be the same as its logical name,
      that is, <span class="code">rain</span>, but this can be overridden.
      The aggregation type will be summing (overriding the averaging
      specified in sub-section <span class="code">[[month_images]]</span>), so
      you get the total rain over the aggregate period (rather than the average)
      over an aggregation interval of 86,400 seconds (one day). The plot line
      will be titled with the indicated label of 'Rain (daily total)'.
      The result of all this is the following plot:
    </p>

    <img src="images/sample_monthrain.png" alt="Sample monthly rain plot" />
    </p>

    <h3 id="line_gaps">Line gaps</h3>    
      <p id="line_gap_fraction">If there is a time gap in the data, the options <span class="code">line_gap_fraction</span>
        and <span class="code">bar_gap_fraction</span> control how it will be
        drawn. The former, <span class="code">line_gap_fraction</span>, is used
        for line graphs, the latter, <span class="code">bar_gap_fraction</span>,
        for bar graphs. Here's what the resultant plots look like without and
        with this option being specified:</p>
      <div class="center" style="width:80%;margin:0;">
        <div style="float:left">
          <img src="images/day-gap-not-shown.png" alt="Gap not shown" />
          <p class="image_caption"> No <span class="code">line_gap_fraction</span> specified</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="images/day-gap-showing.png" alt="Gap showing" />
          <p class="image_caption"> With <span class="code">line_gap_fraction=0.01</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both"></div>
      <h3>Including more than one SQL type in a plot</h3>
      <p>More than one SQL type can be included in a plot. For example, here is
        how to generate a plot with the week's outside temperature as well as
        dewpoint: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[monthtempdew]]]
    [[[[outTemp]]]]
    [[[[dewpoint]]]]</pre>
      <p>This would create an image in file <span class="code">monthtempdew.png</span>
        that includes a line plot of both outside temperature and dewpoint. </p>

      <h3 id="including_same_sql_type_2x">Including the same SQL type more than once in a plot</h3>
      <p>Another example. Say you want a plot of the day's temperature, overlaid
        with hourly averages. Here, you are using the same data type (<span class="code">outTemp</span>)
        for both plot lines, the first with averages, the second without. If you
        do the obvious it won't work: </p>
      <pre class="tty">## WRONG ##
[[[daytemp_with_avg]]]
    [[[[outTemp]]]]
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 3600
    <span style="text-decoration:line-through; color:red">[[[[outTemp]]]]</span>  # OOPS! The same section name appears more than once!</pre>
      <p>The option parser does not allow the same section name (<span class="code">outTemp</span>
        in this case) to appear more than once at a given level in the
        configuration file, so an error will be declared (technical reason:
        formally, the sections are an unordered dictionary). If you wish for the
        same SQL type to appear more than once in a plot then there is a trick
        you must know: use option <span class="code">data_type</span>. This
        will override the default action that the logical line name is used for
        the SQL type. So, our example would look like this: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[daytemp_with_avg]]]
    [[[[a_logical_name]]]]
        data_type = outTemp
        aggregate_type = avg
        aggregate_interval = 3600
        label = Avg. Temp.
    [[[[outTemp]]]]</pre>
      <p>Here, the first logical line has been given the name <span class="code">a_logical_name</span>
        to distinguish it from the second line <span class="code">outTemp</span>.
        We have specified that the first line will use data type <span class="code">
          outTemp</span> and that it will use averaging over a one hour period.
        The second also uses <span class="code">outTemp</span>, but will not
        use averaging. </p>
      <p>The result is a nice plot of the day's temperature, overlaid with a
        3-hour smoothed average: </p>
      <p>
      <img alt="Daytime temperature with running average" src="images/daytemp_with_avg.png" />
      </p>
      <p>One more example. This one shows daily high and low temperatures for a
        year:</p>
      <pre class="tty">[[year_images]]
    [[[yearhilow]]]
        [[[[hi]]]]
            data_type = outTemp
            aggregate_type = max
            label = High
        [[[[low]]]]
            data_type = outTemp
            aggregate_type = min
            label = Low Temperature</pre>
      <p>This results in the plot <span class="code">yearhilow.png</span>:</p>
      <p>
        <img width="300" height="180" alt="Daily highs and lows"
             src="images/yearhilow.png" />
      </p>
      <h3>Progressive vector plots</h3>
      <p><span class="code">Weewx</span> can produce progressive vector plots as
        well as the more conventional x-y plots. To produce these, use plot type
        <span class="code">vector</span>. You need a vector type to produce
        this kind of plot. There are two: <span class="code">windvec</span>,
        and <span class="code">windgustvec</span>. While they do not actually
        appear in the SQL database, <span class="code">weewx</span> understands
        that they represent special vector-types. The first, <span class="code">windvec</span>,
        represents the average wind in an archive period, the second, <span class="code">windgustvec</span>
        the max wind in an archive period. Here's how to produce a progressive
        vector for one week that shows the hourly biggest wind gusts, along with
        hourly averages: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[weekgustoverlay]]]
    aggregate_interval = 3600
    [[[[windvec]]]]
        label = Hourly Wind 
        plot_type = vector
        aggregate_type = avg
    [[[[windgustvec]]]]
        label = Gust Wind 
        plot_type = vector
        aggregate_type = max</pre>
      <p>This will produce an image file with name <span class="code">weekgustoverlay.png</span>.
        It will consist of two progressive vector plots, both using hourly
        aggregation (3,600 seconds). For the first set of vectors, the hourly
        average will be used. In the second, the max of the gusts will be used:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img alt="hourly average wind vector overlaid with gust vectors"
          src="images/weekgustoverlay.png" />
      </p>
      <p>By default, the sticks in the progressive wind plots point towards the
        wind source. That is, the stick for a wind from the west will point
        left. If you have a chronic wind direction (as I do), you may want to
        rotate the default direction so that all the vectors do not line up over
        the x-axis, overlaying each other. Do this by using option <span class="code">vector_rotate</span>.
        For example, with my chronic westerlies, I set <span class="code">vector_rotate</span>
        to 90.0 for the plot above, so winds out of the west point straight up.
      </p>
      <p>If you use this kind of plot (the out-of-the-box version of <span class="code">weewx</span>
        includes daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly progressive wind plots), a
        small compass rose will be put in the lower-left corner of the image to
        show the orientation of North. </p>
      <h3>Overriding values</h3>
      <p>Remember that values at any level can override values specified at a
        higher level. For example, say you want to generate the standard plots,
        but for a few key observation types such as barometer, you want to also
        generate some oversized plots to give you extra detail, perhaps for an
        HTML popup. The standard <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> file
        specifies plot size of 300x180 pixels, which will be used for all plots
        unless overridden: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[ImageGenerator]
    ...
    image_width = 300
    image_height = 180</pre>
      <p>The standard plot of barometric pressure will appear in <span class="code">daybarometer.png</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[daybarometer]]]
    [[[[barometer]]]] </pre>
      <p>We now add our special plot of barometric pressure, but specify a
        larger image size. This image will be put in file <span class="code">daybarometer_big.png</span>.
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[daybarometer_big]]]
    image_width  = 600
    image_height = 360
    [[[[barometer]]]]</pre>    
    
    
    <h2>Using multiple bindings</h2>
    <p>
      It's easy to use more than one database in your reports. Here's an
      example. In my office I have two consoles: a VantagePro2 connected to a
      Dell Optiplex, and a WMR100N, connected to a Raspberry Pi. Each is
      running <span class="code">weewx</span>. The Dell is using SQLite, the
      RPi, MySQL.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose I wish to compare the inside temperatures of the two
      consoles. How would I do that?</p>
    <p>
      It's easier to access MySQL across a network than SQLite, so let's run the
      reports on the Dell, but access the RPi's MySQL database remotely. Here's
      how the bindings and database sections of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
      would look on the Dell:
    </p>
    <pre class="tty">[DataBindings]
    # This section binds a data store to an actual database
    
    [[wx_binding]]
        # The database to be used - it should match one of the sections in [Databases] 
        database = archive_sqlite
        # The name of the table within the database
        table_name = archive
        # The class to manage the database
        manager = weewx.wxmanager.WXDaySummaryManager
        # The schema defines to structure of the database contents
        schema = schemas.wview.schema

<span class="highlight">    [[wmr100_binding]]
        # Binding for my WMR100 on the RPi
        database = rpi_mysql
        # The name of the table within the database
        table_name = archive
        # The class to manage the database
        manager = weewx.wxmanager.WXDaySummaryManager
        # The schema defines to structure of the database contents
        schema = schemas.wview.schema</span>

[Databases]
    # This section binds to the actual database to be used
    
    [[archive_sqlite]]
        root = %(WEEWX_ROOT)s
        database_name = archive/weewx.sdb
        driver = weedb.sqlite
    
<span class="highlight">    [[rpi_mysql]]
        host = rpi-bug
        user = weewx
        password = weewx
        database_name = weewx
        driver = weedb.mysql</span>
    </pre>

    <p>
      The two additions have been <span class="highlight">highlighted</span>.
      The first, in section <span class="code">[DataBindings]</span>, adds a new
      binding called <span class="code">wmr10_binding</span>. It links ("binds")
      to the new database, called <span class="code">rpi_mysql</span>, through
      the option <span class="code">database</span>. The new database is a MySQL
      database, running on the remote host <span class="code">rpi-bug</span>,
      the name of my Raspberry Pi.
    </p>

    <h3>Explicit binding in tags</h3>    
    <p>How do we use this new binding? First, let's do a text comparison,
      using tags. Here's what our template looks like:</p>
    <pre class="tty">&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_label"&gt;Inside Temperature, Vantage&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_data"&gt;$current.inTemp&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_label"&gt;Inside Temperature, WMR100&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class="stats_data"&gt;$latest<span class="highlight">($data_binding='wmr100_binding')</span>.inTemp&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      The explicit binding to <span class="code">wmr100_binding</span> is
      highlighted. This tells the reporting engine to override the default
      binding specifed in <span class="code">[StdReport]</span>, generally <span
        class="code">wx_binding</span>, and use <span class="code">wmr100_binding</span>
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>This results in an HTML output that looks like:</p>

    <div id="stats_group" class="indent">
      <div class="stats example_output">
        <table>
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td class="stats_label">Inside Temperature, Vantage</td>
                <td class="stats_data">68.7&#176;F</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="stats_label">Inside Temperature, WMR100</td>
                <td class="stats_data">68.9&#176;F</td>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Explicit binding in images</h3>
    <p>How would we produce a graph of the two different temperatures? Here's
    what the relevant section of the <span class="code">skin.conf</span> file would look like.</p>
    <pre class="tty">[[[daycompare]]]
   [[[[inTemp]]]]
       label = Vantage inTemp
       [[[[WMR100Temp]]]]
           data_type = inTemp
           data_binding = wmr100_binding
           label = WMR100 inTemp</pre>

    <p>
      This will produce an image with name <span class="code">daycompare.png</span>,
      with two plot lines. The first will be of the temperature from the
      Vantage. It uses the default binding, <span class="code">wx_binding</span>,
      and will be labeled <span class="code">Vantage inTemp</span>. The second
      explicitly uses the <span class="code">wmr100_binding</span>. Because it
      uses the same variable name (<span class="code">inTemp</span>) as the
      first line, we had to explicitly specify it using option <span
        class="code">data_type</span>, in order to avoid using the same
      sub-section name twice (see the section <em><a
        href="#including_same_sql_type_2x">Including the same SQL
          type more than once in a plot</a></em> for details). It will be labeled <span
        class="code">WMR100 inTemp</span>. The results look like this:
    </p>
    <img src='images/daycompare.png' />

    <h3 id="stupid_detail">Stupid detail</h3>
    <p>
      At first, I could not get this example to work. The problem turned out to
      be that the RPi was processing things just a beat behind the Dell, so the
      temperature for the "current" time wasn't ready when the Dell needed it. I
      kept getting <span class="code">N/A</span>. To avoid this, I introduced
      the tag <span class="code">$latest</span>, which uses the last available
      timestamp in the binding, which may or may not be the same as what <span
        class="code">$current</span> uses.
    </p>

      </table>
      <p>If you take a look at the template
        <span class="code">index.html.tmpl</span> you will see
        examples of testing for these tags (search the file for the
        string <span class="code">radar_img</span> to find them).
      </p>
      <p class="config_option">radar_img</p>
      <p>Set to an URL to show a local radar image for you.</p>
      <p class="config_option">radar_url</p>
      <p>If the above radar image is clicked, the browser will go to
       this URL. This is usually used to show a more detailed,
       close-up, radar picture.
      </p>
      <p>For me in Oregon, setting the above two options to:</p>
      <pre class="tty">
[Extras]
    radar_img = http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/lite/N0R/RTX_loop.gif
    radar_url = http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/radar.php?product=NCR&amp;rid=RTX&amp;loop=yes</pre>
      <p>results in a nice image of a radar centered on Portland,
        Oregon. When you click on it, it gives you a detailed, animated view.
        If you live in the USA, take a look at
        the <a href="http://radar.weather.gov/">NOAA radar website</a>
        to find a nice one that will work for you. In other countries, you
        will have to consult your local weather service.
      </p>
      <p class="config_option">googleAnalyticsId </p>
      <p>If you have a <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google
          Analytics ID</a>, you can set it here. The Google Analytics
        Javascript code will then be included, enabling analytics of your
        website usage. If commented out, the code will not be included. </p>

      <h3>Extending <span class="code">[Extras]</span></h3>
      <p>Other tags can be added in a similar manner, including sub-sections.
        For example, say you have added a video camera and you would like to
        add a still image with a hyperlink to a page with the video. You want
        all of these options to be neatly contained in a sub-section. </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Extras]
    [[video]]
        still = video_capture.jpg
        hyperlink = <a href="http://www.eatatjoes.com/video.html">http://www.eatatjoes.com/video.html</a></pre>
      <p>Then in your template you could refer to these as: </p>
      <pre class="tty">&lt;a href="$Extras.video.hyperlink"&gt;
    &lt;img src="$Extras.video.still" alt="Video capture"/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Units]</h2>
      <p>This section deals with Units and their formatting. </p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Groups]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section lists all the <em>Unit Groups</em> and specifies
        which unit system is to be used for each one of them. </p>
      <p>As there are many different observational measurement types (such as
        <span class="code">outTemp</span>, <span class="code">barometer</span>,
        etc.) used in <span class="code">weewx</span> (more than 50 at last
        count), it would be tedious, not to say possibly inconsistent, to
        specify a different measurement system for each one of them. At the
        other extreme, requiring all of them to be "U.S. Customary" or "Metric"
        seems overly restrictive. <span class="code">Weewx</span> has taken a
        middle route and divided all the different observation types into 12
        different <em>unit groups</em>. A unit group is something like <span
          class="code">group_temperature</span>. It represents the measurement
        system to be used by all observation types that are measured in
        temperature, such as inside temperature
        (type <span class="code">inTemp</span>),
        outside temperature (<span class="code">outTemp</span>),
        dewpoint (<span class="code">dewpoint</span>),
        wind chill (<span class="code">windchill</span>),
        and so on. If you decide that you want unit group <span class="code">group_temperature</span>
        to be measured in <span class="code">degree_C</span> then you are
        saying <em>all</em> members of its group will be reported in degrees
        Celsius. </p>
      <p>Note that the unit system is always specified in the singular. That is,
        specify <span class="code">degree_C</span> or <span class="code">foot</span>,
        not <span class="code">degrees_C</span> or <span class="code">feet</span>.
        See the <em><a href="#units">Appendix: Units</a></em> for more
        information, including a concise summary of the groups, their members,
        and which options can be used for each group. </p>
      <p class="config_important"><a class="config_option" id="group_altitude">group_altitude</a>
      </p>
      <p>Which measurement unit to be used for altitude. Possible options are
        <span class="code">foot</span> or <span class="code">meter</span>.</p>
      <p class="config_option">group_direction </p>
      <p>Which measurement unit to be used for direction. The only option is <span
          class="code">degree_compass</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_moisture </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for soil moisture. The only option is <span
          class="code">centibar</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_percent </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for percentages. The only option is <span
          class="code">percent</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_pressure </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for pressure. Possible options are one
        of <span class="code">inHg</span> (inches of mercury), <span class="code">mbar</span>,
        or <span class="code">hPa</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_radiation </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for radiation. The only option is <span
          class="code">watt_per_meter_squared</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_rain </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for precipitation. Options are <span class="code">inch</span>,
        <span class="code">cm</span>, or <span class="code">mm</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_rainrate </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for rate of precipitation. Possible
        options are one of <span class="code">inch_per_hour</span>, <span class="code">cm_per_hour</span>,
        or <span class="code">mm_per_hour</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_speed </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for wind speeds. Possible options are
        one of <span class="code">mile_per_hour</span>, <span class="code">km_per_hour</span>,
        <span class="code">knot</span>, or <span class="code">meter_per_second</span>.
        </p>
      <p class="config_important">group_speed2 </p>
      <p>This group is similar to <span class="code">group_speed</span>, but is
        used for calculated wind speeds which typically have a slightly higher
        resolution. Possible options are one <span class="code">mile_per_hour2</span>,
        <span class="code">km_per_hour2</span>, <span class="code">knot2</span>,
        or <span class="code">meter_per_second2</span>. </p>
      <p><a class="config_important" id="group_temperature">group_temperature</a>
      </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for temperatures. Options are <span class="code">degree_F</span>
        or <span class="code">degree_C</span>. </p>
      <p class="config_option">group_volt </p>
      <p>The measurement unit to be used for voltages. The only option is <span
          class="code">volt</span>. </p>
      <h3 class="config_section" id="Units_StringFormats">[[StringFormats]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section is used to specify what string format is to be used
        for each unit when a quantity needs to be converted to a string.
        Typically, this happens with y-axis labeling on plots and for statistics
        in HTML file generation. For example, the options </p>
      <pre class="tty">degree_C = %.1f
inch     = %.2f</pre>
      <p>would specify that the given string formats are to be used when
        formatting any temperature measured in degrees Celsius or any
        precipitation amount measured in inches, respectively. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language">
          formatting codes are those used by Python</a>, and are very similar
        to C's <span class="code">sprintf()</span> codes. </p>
      <p>You can also specify what string to use for an invalid or unavailable
        measurement (value <span class="code">None</span>). For example, </p>
      <pre class="tty">NONE = " N/A "</pre>

      <h3 class="config_section" id="Units_Labels">[[Labels]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section specifies what label is to be used for each
        measurement unit type. For example, the options </p>
      <pre class="tty">degree_F = °F
inch     = ' in'</pre>
      <p>would cause all temperatures to have unit labels <span class="code">°F</span>
        and all precipitation to have labels <span class="code">in</span>. If
        any special symbols are to be used (such as the degree sign above) they
        should be encoded in UTF-8. This is generally what most text editors use
        if you cut-and-paste from a character map.</p>

      <p> If the label includes two values, then the first is assumed to be the
        singular form, the second the plural form. For example,</p>
      <pre class="tty">foot   = " foot",   " feet"
...
day    = " day",    " days"
hour   = " hour",   " hours"
minute = " minute", " minutes"
second = " second", " seconds"</pre>

      <p>This is particularly useful when <a href="#l11n_unit_labels">localizing the weewx and server uptimes</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="config_section" id="Units_TimeFormats">[[TimeFormats]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section is used for time labels. It uses <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-behavior">strftime()</a>
        formats. The default looks like this:</p>
      <pre class='tty'>
    [[TimeFormats]]
        # This section sets the string format to be used for each time scale.
        # The values below will work in every locale, but may not look
        # particularly attractive. See the Customizing Guide for alternatives.

        day        = %X
        week       = %X (%A)
        month      = %x %X
        year       = %x %X
        rainyear   = %x %X
        current    = %x %X
        ephem_day  = %X
        ephem_year = %x %X</pre>

      <p>The specifiers <span class='code'>%x</span>, <span class='code'>%X</span>,
        and <span class='code'>%A</span>
        code locale dependent date, time, and weekday names, respectively.
        Hence, if you set an appropriate environment variable <span class='code'>LANG</span>,
        then the date and times should follow local conventions (see section
        <a href="#environment_variable_LANG">Environment variable LANG</a> 
        for details on how to do this). However, they will not look particularly pretty
        and you may want to change them. For example, I use this in the U.S.:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">
    [[TimeFormats]]
        #
        # More attractive formats that work in most Western countries.
        #
        day        = %H:%M
        week       = %H:%M on %A
        month      = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        year       = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        rainyear   = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        current    = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M
        ephem_day  = %H:%M
        ephem_year = %d-%b-%Y %H:%M</pre>

      <p>The last two formats, <span class='code'>ephem_day</span> and
        <span class='code'>ephem_year</span> allow the formatting to be set for almanac times
        The first, <span class="code">ephem_day</span>, is used for
        almanac times within the day, such as sunrise or sunset. The second, 
        <span class="code">ephem_year</span>, is used for almanac times within the
        year, such as the next equinox or full moon. </p>

      <h3 class="config_section">[[Ordinates]]</h3>
      <p class="config_option">directions</p>
      <p>Set to the abbreviations to be used for ordinal directions. By default,
        this is <span class="code">N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW,
          SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW, N</span>.</p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[DegreeDays]]</h3>
      <p class="config_important">heating_base <br />
        cooling_base </p>
      <p>Set to the base temperature for calculating heating and cooling
        degree-days, along with the unit to be used. Examples:</p>
      <pre class="tty">heating_base = 65.0, degree_F
cooling_base = 20.0, degree_C</pre>
      <h3 class="config_section" id="trend">[[Trend]]</h3>
      <p class="config_option">time_delta</p>
      <p>Set to the time difference over which you want trends to be calculated.
        The default is 3 hours.</p>
      <p class="config_option">time_grace</p>
      <p>When searching for a previous record to be used in calculating a trend,
      a record within this amount of <span class="code">time_delta</span>
      will be accepted. Default is 300 seconds.</p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Labels]</h2>
      <p>This section sets the various labels to use. </p>
      <p class="config_option">hemispheres </p>
      <p>Comma separated list for the labels to be used for the four
        hemispheres. The default is <span class="code">N, S, E, W</span>.</p>
                <p class="config_option">latlon_formats</p>
                <p>Comma separated list for the formatting to be used when converting 
                latitude and longitude to strings. There should be three elements:</p>
                <ol>
                        <li>The format to be used for whole degrees of latitude</li>
                        <li>The format to be used for whole degrees of longitude</li>
                        <li>The format to be used for minutes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This allows you to decide whether or not you want leading zeroes. The 
                default includes leading zeroes and is &quot;%02d&quot;, &quot;%03d&quot;, &quot;%05.2f&quot;</p>
      <h3 class="config_section">[[Generic]]</h3>
      <p>This sub-section specifies default labels to be used for each observation
        type. For example, options </p>
      <pre class="tty">inTemp = Temperature inside the house
outTemp = Outside Temperature</pre>
      <p>would cause the given labels to be used for plots of <span
          class="code">inTemp</span> and <span class="code">outTemp</span>. 
          If no option is given, then the observation type itself will
          be used (<em>e.g., </em><span class="code">outTemp</span>).</p>
      <h2 class="config_section">[Almanac]</h2>
      <p>This section controls what text to use for the almanac. It consists of
        only one entry </p>
      <p class="config_option">moon_phases </p>
      <p>This option is a comma separated list of labels to be used for the
        eight phases of the moon. Default is <span class="code">New, Waxing
          crescent, First quarter, Waxing gibbous, Full, Waning gibbous, Last
          quarter, Waning crescent</span>. </p>

      <h2 class="config_section">[CheetahGenerator]</h2>
      <p>This section is used by generator
        <span class="code">weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator</span>
        and controls text generation from templates, specifically which files
        are to be produced from which template. </p>

      <h3>Overview of file generation</h3>
      <p>Files are generated from templates, and each template is identified
        by the <span class="config_option">template</span> parameter.</p>
      <p>Each template file is named something like
        <span class="code"><em>D/F.E.tmpl</em></span>, where
        <span class="code">D</span> is the (optional) directory the
        template sits in and will also be the directory the results will be
        put in, and <span class="code">F.E</span> is the generated file name.
        So, given a template file with name <span class="code">Acme/index.html.tmpl</span>,
        the results will be put in <span class="symcode">$HTML_ROOT</span><span class="code">/Acme/index.html</span>. </p>
      <p>The configuration for a group of templates will look something like this:</p>
    <pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]
    [[index]]
        template = index.html.tmpl
    [[textfile]]
        template = filename.txt.tmpl
    [[xmlfile]]
        template = filename.xml.tmpl</pre>
      <p>There can be only one <span class="config_option">template</span> in
        each block.  In most cases, the block name does not matter &mdash; it is
        used only to isolate each template.  However, there are two block names
        that have special meaning:  <span class='code'>SummaryByMonth</span> and 
        <span class='code'>SummaryByYear</span>.  They are described below.</p>
      <p>The file generator runs on each new archive record.  In a default
        weewx installation, that would be every 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>Cheetah processes each template to generate a file.  Cheetah follows
        any logic defined by directives such as <span class="code">for</span>
        or <span class="code">if ... else</span>, and it replaces variables
        such as <span class="code">$Extras.radar_url</span> or
        <span class="code">$current.outTemp.max</span>.</p>
      <p>Variables are defined by objects in weewx.  Some variables are static,
        others are linked to data in databases.  The list of variables can be
        extended.</p>

      <h3>File generation options</h3>
      <p class="config_option">search_list</p>
      <p>This is the list of search list objects that will be scanned by 
        the template engine, looking for tags. See the section
        <em><a href="#defining_new_tags">Defining new tags</a></em> and the 
        <a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org/docs/users_guide_html/users_guide.html">Cheetah documentation</a> for details on 
        search lists. If no <span class="config_option">search_list</span>
        is specified, a default list will be
        used.  The default list is:</p>
      <pre class="tty">search_list = weewx.cheetahgenerator.Almanac, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Station, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Stats, weewx.cheetahgenerator.UnitInfo, weewx.cheetahgenerator.Extras</pre>
      <p class="config_option">search_list_extensions</p>
      <p>This defines one or more search list objects that will be appended to
        the <span class="config_option">search_list</span>.  For example, the
        following adds alltime and forecast variables to the search list.</p>
      <pre class="tty">search_list_extensions = examples.xsearch.MyXSearch, user.forecast.ForecastVariables</pre>
      <p class="config_option">encoding </p>
      <p>This option controls which encoding is to be used for the generated
        output. The encoding can be specified for individual files.  There are
        3 possible choices: </p>
      <table class="indent">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="first_row">
            <td>Encoding</td>
            <td>Comments</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">html_entities</td>
            <td>Non 7-bit characters will be represented
              as HTML entities (<em>e.g.</em>, the degree sign will be
              represented as <span class="code">&amp;#176;</span>)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">utf8</td>
            <td>Non 7-bit characters will be represented in UTF-8.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">strict_ascii</td>
            <td>Non 7-bit characters will be ignored.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The encoding <span class="code">html_entities</span> is the
        default.</p>
      <p class="config_option">template</p>
      <p>The name of a template file.  A template filename must end with
        <span class="code">.tmpl</span>.  Filenames are case-sensitive.
        If the template filename has the letters <span class="code">YYYY</span>
        or <span class="code">MM</span> in its name, these will be substituted
        for the year and month, respectively. So, a template with the name
        <span class="code">summary-YYYY-MM.html.tmpl</span> would have name
        <span class="code">summary-2010-03.html</span> for the month of March,
        2010.</p>
      <p class="config_option">stale_age</p>
      <p>
        File staleness age, in seconds. If the file is older than this age it will
        be generated from the template. If no <span class="code">stale_age</span>
        is specified, then the file will be generated every time the generator
        runs.
      </p>
      <p class="config_option">[[SummaryByMonth]]</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">SummaryByMonth</span> section defines some
        special behavior.  Each template in this section will be used
        multiple times, each time with a different per-month timespan.
        Be sure to include <span class="code">YYYY</span> and 
        <span class="code">MM</span> in the filename of any template in this
        section.</p>
      <p class="config_option">[[SummaryByYear]]</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">SummaryByYear</span> section defines some
        special behavior.  Each template in this section will be used
        multiple times, each time with a different per-year timespan.

        of any template in this section.</p>

      <h3>Customizing file generation</h3>
      <p>The best way to customize file generation is to make a copy of
        a working report/skin, then make incremental changes.</p>
      <p>When there is an error during template generation, the error will
        show up in the log file.  Many errors are obvious &mdash; Cheetah will
        display a line number and list the template file in which the error
        occurred.  In some cases the error reporting is rather obscure.  So
        make small changes and test often.  Use the tool
        <span class="code"><a href="#wee_reports">wee_reports</a></span>
        to test modifications to the generator configuration and/or the
        template contents.</p>

      <h3>The Standard skin templates</h3>
      <p>Here is the <span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span> section from
        the Standard <span class="code">skin.conf</span></p>

      <pre class="tty">[CheetahGenerator]
    # This section is used by the generator CheetahGenerator, and specifies
    # which files are to be generated from which template.

    encoding = html_entities

        [[[NOAA_month]]]
            encoding = strict_ascii
            template = NOAA/NOAA-YYYY-MM.txt.tmpl

        [[[NOAA_year]]]
            encoding = strict_ascii
            template = NOAA/NOAA-YYYY.txt.tmpl
        
    [[ToDate]]
        # Reports that show statistics "to date", such as day-to-date,
        # week-to-date, month-to-date, etc.

        [[[month]]]
            template = month.html.tmpl

        [[[Mobile]]]
            template = mobile.html.tmpl</pre>

      <p>The Standard skin contains three different kinds of generated
        output: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Summary by Month. The Standard skin uses
          <span class="code">SummaryByMonth</span> to produce NOAA summaries,
          one for each month, as a simple text file.</li>
        <li>Summary by Year. The Standard skin uses
          <span class="code">SummaryByYear</span> to produce NOAA summaries,
          one for each year, as a simple text file.</li>
        <li>Summary "To Date". The Standard skin produce reports for the day,
          week, month, and year-to-date observations. These files are HTML.
          The first, the daily summary (output filename is
          <span class="code">index.html</span>),
          includes a drop-down list that displays the NOAA month and yearly
          summaries. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The encoding for text files is <span class="code">strict_ansii</span>,
        whereas the encoding for html files is
        <span class="code">html_entities</span>.  In the Standard skin this is
        specified by declaring
        <span class="code">encoding = html_entities</span> at the top level
        of <span class="code">[CheetahGenerator]</span> then
        <span class="code">encoding = strict_ansii</span> for each text file.
      </p>
      <p>Other than <span class="code">SummaryByMonth</span> and
        <span class="code">SummaryByYear</span>, the section names are
        arbitrary.  <span class="code">ToDate</span> could just as well have
        been called <span class="code">files_to_date</span>, and the sections
        <span class="code">day</span>, <span class="code">week</span>, and
        <span class="code">month</span> could just as well have been called
        <span class="code">tom</span>, <span class="code">dick</span>, and
        <span class="code">harry</span>.</p>

    <p>
      Causes the vectors to be rotated by this many degrees. Positive is clockwise.
      If westerly winds dominate at your location (as they do at mine),
      then you may want to specify <span
        class="code">+90</span> for this option. This will cause the average vector
        to point straight up, rather than lie flat against the x-axis. Optional.
        The default is <span class='code'>0</span>.
    </p>


    <h3>Shared plot line options</h3>
    <p>These are options shared by all the plot lines.</p>

    <p>
      Each chart line is drawn in a different color. This option is a list of
      those colors. If the number of lines exceeds the length of the list, then
      the colors wrap around to the beginning of the list. NB: individual line
      color can be overridden by using option <span class="code">color</span>.
      Optional. In the case of bar charts, this is the color

    <p class="config_option">chart_line_width</p>
    <p>
      Each chart line can be drawn using a different line width. This option is a list of
      these widths. If the number of lines exceeds the length of the list, then
      the widths wrap around to the beginning of the list. NB: individual line
      widths can be overridden by using option <span class="code">width</span>.
      Optional.  Default is <span class="code">1, 1, 1</span>.
    </p>


    <h3>Individual line options</h3>
    <p>These are options that are set for individual lines.</p>
    <p class="config_option">aggregate_type</p>
    <p>
      The default is to plot every data point, but this is
      probably not a good idea for any plot longer than a day. By setting this
      option, you can <em>aggregate</em> data by a set time interval. Available
      aggregation types include <span class="code">avg</span>, <span
        class="code">sum</span>, <span class="code">max</span>, <span

    <p class="config_option">aggregate_interval</p>
    <p>The time period over which the data should be aggregated. Required if
    <span class="code">aggregate_type</span> has been set. </p>
    <p class="config_option">plot_type</p>
    <p>
      The type of plot for this line. Choices are <span class="code">line</span>,
      <span class="code">bar</span>, or <span class="code">vector</span>.

    </p>
    <p class="config_option">line_gap_fraction</p>
    <p>
      If there is a gap between data points bigger than this fractional amount
      of the x-axis, then a gap will be drawn, rather than a connecting line.
      See Section <em><a href="#line_gaps">Line gaps</a></em>. Optional. The
      default is to always draw the line.
    </p>
    <p class="config_option">bar_gap_fraction</p>
    <p>
      If there is a gap between bar graphs bigger than this fractional amount of
      the x-axis, then a gap will be drawn, rather than a fat bar. See Section
      <em><a href="#line_gaps">Line gaps</a></em>. Optional. The default is to
      always draw the bar.
    </p>

    <p class="config_option">width</p>
    <p>
      This option is to override the line widthfor an individual line. Optional.

    <p class="config_option">data_type</p>
    <p>
      The SQL data type to be used for this plot line. For more information,
      see the section
      <em><a href="#including_same_sql_type_2x">Including the same SQL type more than once in a plot</a></em>. Optional. The default is to use the
      section name.
    </p>




    <h2 class="config_section">[CopyGenerator]</h2>
      <p>This section is used by generator <span class="code">weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</span>
        and controls which files are to be copied over from the skin
        directory to the destination directory. Think of it as "file
        generation," except that rather than going through the template engine,
        the files are simply copied over. </p>

      <p class="config_option">copy_once </p>
      <p>This option controls which files get copied over on the first
        invocation of the report engine service. Typically, this is things such
        as style sheets or background GIFs. Wildcards can be used. </p>
      <p class="config_option">copy_always </p>
      <p>This is a list of files that should be copied on every invocation.
        Wildcards can be used. </p>

      <p>Here is the <span class="code">[CopyGenerator]</span> section from
        the Standard <span class="code">skin.conf</span></p>

    # List of files to be copied each time the generator runs
    # copy_always = </pre>
      <p>The Standard skin includes some background images, CSS files, and
        icons that need to be copied once.  There are no files that need
        to be copied every time the generator runs.</p>



      <h2 class="config_section" id="generators_section">[Generators]</h2>
      <p>This section defines the list of generators that should be run.</p>

      <p class="config_option">generator_list </p>
      <p>This option controls which generators get run for this skin. It is a
        comma separated list. The generators will be run in this order. </p>

      <p>Here is the <span class="code">[Generators]</span> section from the

      <pre class="tty">[Generators]
    generator_list = weewx.cheetahgenerator.CheetahGenerator, weewx.imagegenerator.ImageGenerator, weewx.reportengine.CopyGenerator</pre>

      <h1 id="localization">Localization</h1>
      <p>What follows is a guide to localizing to a non-English language
        and/or locale.  There are two parts: translating to different languages
        and modifying to reflect local conventions for displaying data.</p>

      <h2>Translate the templates</h2>
      <p>First, you will need to go through the templates and translate to your
        target language. Obvious text strings such as
        <span class="code">"Current Weather Conditions"</span>
        will need to be translated.</p>

      <h2>Modify the skin configuration</h2>
      <p>Next, you will need to go through <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
        to translate labels and modify formats to follow local conventions.
      </p>

      <p>You will probably want to change the generic labels used for the
        observation types:</p>

      <h1 id="service_engine">Customizing the engine</h1>
      <p>This is an advanced topic intended for those who wish to try their hand
        at extending the internal engine in weewx. You should have a passing
        familiarity with Python or, at least, be willing to learn it. </p>
      <p class="warning">Please note that the API to the service engine may change in future versions!</p>
      <p>At a high level, <span class="code">weewx</span> consists of an <em>engine</em>
        that is responsible for managing a set of <em>services</em>. A service
        consists of a Python class which binds its member functions to various <em>events</em>.
        The engine arranges to have the bound member function called when a
        specific event happens, such as a new LOOP packet arriving. </p>
      <p>To customize, you can </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customize a service </li>
        <li>Add a service </li>
      </ul>
      <p>See the table <a href="#default_services">Default services</a> above for a list
        of the services that are normally run.</p>

      <h2>Customizing a service</h2>
      <p>The service <span class="code">weewx.engine.StdPrint</span> prints
        out new LOOP and archive packets to the console when they arrive. By
        default, it prints out the entire record, which generally includes a lot
        of possibly distracting information and can be rather messy. Suppose you
        do not like this, and want it to print out only the time, barometer
        reading, and the outside temperature whenever a new LOOP packet arrives.
        This could be done by subclassing the default print service <span class="code">StdPrint</span>
        and overriding member function <span class="code">new_loop_packet()</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Create the file <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/user/myprint.py</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">from weewx.engine import StdPrint
from weeutil.weeutil import timestamp_to_string

class MyPrint(StdPrint):

    # Override the default new_loop_packet member function:
    def new_loop_packet(self, event):
        packet = event.packet
        print "LOOP: ", timestamp_to_string(packet['dateTime']),
            "BAR=",  packet.get('barometer', 'N/A'),
            "TEMP=", packet.get('outTemp', 'N/A')</pre>
      <p>This service substitutes a new implementation for the member function <span
          class="code">new_loop_packet</span>. This implementation prints out
        the time, then the barometer reading (or <span class="code">N/A</span>
        if it is not available) and the outside temperature (or <span class="code">N/A</span>).</p>
      <p>You then need to specify that your print service class should be loaded
        instead of the default <span class="code">StdPrint</span> service. This
        is done by substituting your service name for <span class="code">StdPrint</span>
        in <span class="code">service_list</span>, located in <span class="code">[Engine][[Services]]</span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Engine]
    [[Services]]
        ...
        report_services = <span class="highlight">user.myprint.MyPrint</span>, weewx.engine.StdReport</pre>
      <p>Note that the <span class="code">report_services</span> must be all on
        one line. Unfortunately, the parser <span class="code">ConfigObj</span>
        does not allow options to be continued on to following lines.</p>

      <h2>Adding a service</h2>
      <p>Suppose there is no service that can be easily customized for your
        needs. In this case, a new one can easily be created by subclassing off
        the abstract base class <span class="code">StdService</span>, and then
        adding the functionality you need. Here is an example that implements an
        alarm, which sends off an email when an arbitrary expression evaluates <span
          class="code">True</span>. This example is included in the standard
        distribution in directory <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span

      <p>This service expects all the information it needs to be in the
        configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> in a new
        section called <span class="code">[Alarm]</span>. So, add the following
        lines to your configuration file: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Alarm]
    expression = "outTemp &lt; 40.0"
    time_wait = 3600
    smtp_host = smtp.mymailserver.com
    smtp_user = myusername
    smtp_password = mypassword
    mailto = auser@adomain.com, anotheruser@someplace.com
    from   = me@mydomain.com
    subject = "Alarm message from weewx!"</pre>
      <p>There are two important points to be noted in this example, each marked
        with a <span class="code">NOTE</span> flag in the code.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Here is where the binding happens between an event, <span
        class="code">weewx.NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD</span> in this example, and a
        member function, <span class="code">self.newArchiveRecord</span>. When
        the event <span class='code'>NEW_ARCHIVE_RECORD</span> occurs,
        the function <span class="code">self.newArchiveRecord</span> will be called. There
        are many other events that can be interecepted. Look in the file <span
        class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span class="code">/weewx/__init__.py</span>.
      </li>
      <li>This is where the test is done for whether or not to sound the
        alarm. The <span class="code">[Alarm]</span> configuration options
        specify that the alarm be sounded when <span class="code">outTemp
          &lt; 40.0</span> evaluates <span class="code">True</span>, that is when the
        outside temperature is below 40.0 degrees. Any valid Python expression
        can be used, although the only variables available are those in the
        current archive record.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Another example expression could be: </p>
      <pre class="tty">expression = "outTemp &lt; 32.0 and windSpeed &gt; 10.0"</pre>
      <p>In this case, the alarm is sounded if the outside temperature drops
        below freezing and the wind speed is greater than 10.0. </p>
      <p>Note that units must be the same as whatever is being used in your database.
      That is, the same as what you specified in option 
      <a href="usersguide.htm#option_target_unit"><span class="code">target_unit</span></a>.</p>
      <p>Option <span class="code">time_wait</span> is used to avoid a flood of
        nearly identical emails. The new service will wait this long before
        sending another email out. </p>
      <p>Email will be sent through the SMTP host specified by option <span class="code">smtp_host</span>.
        The recipient(s) are specified by the comma separated option <span class="code">mailto</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Many SMTP hosts require user login. If this is the case, the user and
        password are specified with options <span class="code">smtp_user</span>
        and <span class="code">smtp_password</span>, respectively. </p>
      <p>The last two options, <span class="code">from</span> and <span class="code">subject</span>
        are optional. If not supplied, <span class="code">weewx</span> will
        supply something sensible. Note, however, that some mailers require a
        valid "from" email address and the one <span class="code">weewx</span>
        supplies may not satisfy its requirements. </p>
      <p>To make this all work, you must tell the engine to load this new
        service. This is done by adding your service name to the list <span class="code">report_services</span>,
        located in <span class="code">[Engine][[Services]]</span>: </p>
      <pre class="tty">[Engine]
   [[Services]]
        report_services = weewx.engine.StdPrint, weewx.engine.StdReport<span class="highlight">, examples.alarm.MyAlarm</span></pre>
      <p>Again, note that the option <span class="code">report_services</span> must be all on
        one line &mdash; the parser <span class="code">ConfigObj</span>
        does not allow options to be continued on to following lines.</p>
      <p>In addition to the example above, the distribution also includes a
        low-battery alarm (<span class="code">lowBattery.py</span>), which is
        similar, except that it intercepts LOOP events (instead of
        archiving events). </p>

      <h1 id ="archive_database">Customizing the database</h1>
      <p>For most users the default database will work just fine. It has the
        added advantage of being compatible with the wview database.
        Nevertheless, there may be occasions where you may want to add a SQL
        type to your database, or change its unit system. This section shows you
        how to do this, using the utility <span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span><span
          class="code">/wee_config_database</span>.</p>
      <p>This utility also has the ability to check a SQLite version of the archive
        database for embedded strings (where a float is expected).</p>
      <p>Before starting, it's worth running the utility with the <span class="code">--help</span>
        flag to see how it is used:</p>
      <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_database --help</pre>
      <p>This will result in an output that looks something like this:</p>
      <pre class="tty">
Usage: wee_config_database: [config_path] 
                            [--config=CONFIG_PATH] [--help]

                            [--binding=BINDING_NAME]

       The path to the config file can be specified as either a
       command-line argument, or by using option --config. 

Configure the weewx databases. Most of these functions are handled
automatically by weewx, but they may be useful as a utility in special cases.
In particular, the 'reconfigure' option can be useful if you decide to add or
drop data types from the database schema or change unit systems.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config=CONFIG_PATH  Use configuration file CONFIG_PATH. Default is
                        /etc/weewx/weewx.conf or /home/weewx/weewx.conf.
  --create-archive      Create the archive database.
  --drop-daily          Drop the daily summary tables from a database.
  --backfill-daily      Backfill a database with daily summaries.
  --reconfigure         Create a new archive database using configuration
                        information found in the configuration file. In
                        particular, the new database will use the unit system
                        found in option [StdConvert][target_unit]. The new
                        database will have the same name as the old database,
                        with a '_new' on the end.
  --string-check        Check a sqlite version of the archive database for
                        embedded strings in it.
  --fix                 If a string is found, fix it.
  --binding=BINDING     The database binding to be used. Default is
                        'wx_binding'.

If you are using the MySQL database it is assumed that you have the
appropriate permissions for the requested operation.</pre>

      <h2>Adding a new observation type</h2>
      <p>Suppose you have installed an electric meter at your house and you wish
        to correlate electrical usage with the weather. The meter has some sort
        of connection to your computer, allowing you to download the
        consumption. At the end of every archive interval you want to sample the
        meter for the electricity consumed during the interval, then store the
        results in the archive database, along with the weather data. How would
        you do this?</p>
      <p>First, you would write a custom service that retrieves the electrical
        consumption data and adds it to the archive record. See the section <a

      <p>This adds a new key <span class="code">electricity</span> to the
        record dictionary and sets it equal to some value. As an aside, if you
        do something like this, you would want to make sure that the code to
        retrieve the current electrical consumption does not delay very long so
        it does not slow down the main loop. If it's going to cause a delay of
        more than a couple seconds you might want to put it in a separate thread
        and feed the results to <span class="code">AddElectricity</span>
        through a queue.</p>
      <p>To make sure your service gets run, you need to add it to one of the 
      service lists in section <span class="code">[Engine]</span> in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. But where? You want
      to make sure it runs before the archiving service, so it must be
      before option <span class="code">archive_services</span>. You do not want it to run
      before the main loop runs, so it can't be in <span class="code">prep_services</span>. Probably
      the best place is at the end of <span class="code">process_services</span>. When you're
      done, your section <span class="code">[Engine]</span> will look something like this:</p>
      <pre class="tty">
[Engine]
    # This section configures the maine engine. It is for advanced customization.

    [[Services]]
        # These are the services the main engine should run:
        prep_services = weewx.engine.StdTimeSynch
        process_services = weewx.engine.StdConvert, weewx.engine.StdCalibrate, weewx.engine.StdQC, weewx.wxservices.StdWXCalculate<span class="highlight">, user.electricity.AddElectricity</span>
        archive_services = weewx.engine.StdArchive
        restful_services = weewx.restx.StdStationRegistry, weewx.restx.StdWunderground, weewx.restx.StdPWSweather, weewx.restx.StdCWOP, weewx.restx.StdWOW, weewx.restx.StdAWEKAS
        report_services = weewx.engine.StdPrint, weewx.engine.StdReport</pre>

    <h3 id="add_archive_type">Adding a new type to the archive database</h3>
    <p>
      So, now you have created a new observation type, <span class="code">electricity</span>.
      Trouble is, there is no corresponding type in the schema of the SQL
      database and, therefore, <span class="code">weewx</span> won't know
      where to store it. How would you add such
      a type?
    </p>
    <p>The utility <span class="code">wee_config_database</span> can be used to do this. It will
    create a new database that is similar to the old database, except it has the new type in its
    schema.</p>
    <p>Here's our general strategy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Extend the existing schema with the new type <span class="code">electricity</span>.</li>
      <li>Modify the <span class="code">wx_binding</span> to use the new schema
      instead of the old.
      </li>
      <li>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create a new
        database.</li>
      <li>Use the utility <span class="code">wee_config_database</span> to create the
      new database and populate it with data from the old database.</li>
      <li>Shuffle databases around so <span class="code">weewx</span> will
        use the new database.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here is the recipe that follows that strategy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Add the new type to our existing schema.</strong> The weather
          schema that comes with <span class="code">weewx</span> is the same as
          what wview uses. It's located in the file <span class="code">schemas/wview.py</span>
          &mdash; take a look at it now. We could just modify it <em>in situ</em>,
          but that would run the risk of confusing the two versions.
          Alternatively, we could copy the file over to a new location, and then
          modify that. But, because our change is just a simple addition, we're
          going to import the wview schema and just add on our new type. There's
          also no reason to create a new file. Why not just do it in the file we
          already have, <span class="code">user/electricity.py</span>? Add to
          the bottom of the file:
        </p> <pre class="tty">import schemas.wview
schema_with_electricity = schemas.wview.schema + [('electricity', 'REAL')]</pre>
        <p>
          This creates a new schema (it will have the name <span class="code">user.electricity.schema_with_electricity</span>),
          that is just like the old one, except it has a new type <span
            class="code">electricity</span> tacked on to the end.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Modify <span class="code">wx_binding</span>.
          </strong> When it creates the new, modified database, <span class="code">wee_config_database</span>
          needs to know to use your new schema instead of the old, wview schema.
          You do this by changing the option <span class="code">schema</span> in
          section <span class="code">[DataBindings]</span> in <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.
          It will look like this when you're done:
        </p>
        <p class="tty">[DataBindings]
    [[wx_binding]]
        database = archive_sqlite
        table_name = archive
        manager = weewx.wxmanager.WXDaySummaryManager
        <span class="highlight">schema = user.electricity.schema_with_electricity</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check permissions.</strong> <span class="code">wee_config_database</span> will
          create a new database with the same name as the old, except with the
          suffix <span class="code">_new</span> attached to the end. Make sure
          you have the necessary permissions to create it. In particular, if you
          are using MySQL, you will need <span class="code">CREATE</span>
          privileges:
        </p>
    <pre class="tty">mysql&gt; GRANT select, update, create, delete, insert ON weewx_new.* TO weewx@localhost;</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create and populate the new database.</strong>
          Now run the utility <span class="code">wee_config_database</span>
          with the <span class="code">--reconfigure</span> option and the path
          to the configuration file:
        </p>
        <p class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_database --reconfigure <span class="symcode">$CONFIG_ROOT</span>/weewx.conf</p>
        <p>
          This will create a new database (nominally, <span class="code">weewx.sdb_new</span>
          if you are using SQLite, <span class="code">weewx_new</span> if you
          are using MySQL) using the new schema and populate it with data from
          the old database.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Shuffle the databases.</strong> Now arrange things so <span
            class="code">weewx</span> can find the new database.
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
          <strong>Warning!</strong><br /> Make a backup of the data before
          doing any of the next steps!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can either shuffle the databases around so the new database has
          the same name as the old database, or edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
          to use the new database name. To do the former:
        </p>
        <p>For SQLite:</p> <pre class="tty">cd <span class="symcode">$SQLITE_ROOT</span>
mv weewx.sdb_new weewx.sdb</pre>
        <p>For MySQL:</p> <pre class="tty">mysql -u &lt;username&gt; --password=&lt;mypassword&gt;
<span class="prompt">mysql&gt;</span> DROP DATABASE weewx;   # Delete the old database
<span class="prompt">mysql&gt;</span> CREATE DATABASE weewx; # Create a new one with the same name
<span class="prompt">mysql&gt;</span> RENAME TABLE weewx_new.archive TO weewx.archive; # Rename to the nominal name</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It's worth noting that there's actually a hidden, last step:
          recreating the daily summaries inside the new database. This will be
          done automatically by <span class="code">weewx</span> at the next
          startup. Alternatively, it can be done manually using the <span
            class="code">wee_config_database</span> utility and the <span
            class="code">--backfill-daily</span> option:
        </p> <pre class="tty"><span class="symcode">$BIN_ROOT</span>/wee_config_database --backfill-daily <span
            class="symcode">$CONFIG_ROOT</span>/weewx.conf</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Using the new type</h3>
      <p>Now you've added a new type. How do you use it? </p>
      <p>Pretty much like any other type. For example, to do a plot of the
        month's electric consumption, totaled by day, add this section to the <span
          class="code">[[month_images]]</span> section of <span class="code">skin.conf</span>:</p>
      <pre class="tty">[[[monthelectric]]]
    [[[[electricity]]]]
        aggregate_type = sum
        aggregate_interval = 86400
        label = Electric consumption (daily total)</pre>
      <p>This will cause the generation of an image <span class="code">monthelectric.png</span>,
        showing a plot of each day's consumption for the past month.</p>
      <p>If you wish to use the new type in the templates, it will be available
        using the same syntax as any other type. Here are some other tags that
        might be useful:</p>
      <table class="indent">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="first_row">
            <td>Tag</td>
            <td>Meaning</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$day.electricity.sum</td>
            <td>Total consumption since midnight</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.sum</td>
            <td>Total consumption since the first of the year</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.max</td>
            <td>The most consumed during any archive period</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.maxsum</td>
            <td>The most consumed during a day</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.maxsumtime</td>
            <td>The day it happened.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code">$year.electricity.sum_ge(5.0)</td>
            <td>The number of days where more than 5.0 kWH of energy was
              consumed.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

    <h2 id="Changing_the_unit_system">Changing the unit system</h2>
    <p>Normally, data are stored in the databases using US Customary units
      and, normally, you don't care; it is an "implementation detail".
      Data can always be displayed using any units you want. The
      <a href="#customizing_reports">Customizing reports</a> section explains
      how to do this. Nevertheless, there
      may be special situations where you wish to store the data in Metric
      units. For example, you may need to allow direct programmatic access to
      the databases from another piece of software that expects metric units.</p>
    <p>
      Weewx does not allow you to change the database unit system midstream. You
      can't start with one unit system then, in the middle of the database,
      switch to another. See the section <span class="code"> <a
        href="usersguide.htm#StdConvert">[StdConvert]</a></span> in the Weewx User's
      Guide. However, you can reconfigure the database by copying it to a new
      database, performing the unit conversion along the way. You then use this
      new database.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the general strategy:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Modify <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> to reflect your
        choice of the new unit system to use. Your choices are <span
        class='code'>US</span>, <span class="code">METRIC</span>, or <span
        class="code">METRICWX</span>. See the
        <em><a href="#units">Appendix: Units</a></em>
        for the exact differences between these three choices.
      </li>
      <li>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create the new
        database.</li>
      <li>Use the utility <span class='code'>wee_config_database</span> to
        create the new database and populate it with data from the old
        database.</li>
      <li>Shuffle databases around so <span class="code">weewx</span> will
        use the new database.
      </li>

    <p>Here is the recipe that follows that strategy:</p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Modify <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>.</strong>
          Edit the configuration file to change option
          <span class="code">target_unit</span> in section
          <span class="code"><a href="usersguide.htm#StdConvert">[StdConvert]</a></span>
          to reflect your choice.  If you are switching to metric units,
          the option will look like:</p>
        <pre class="tty">[StdConvert]
    target_unit = METRICWX</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check permissions.</strong> The reconfiguration utility will
          create a new database with the same name as the old, except with the
          suffix <span class="code">_new</span> attached to the end. Make sure
          you have the necessary permissions to do this. In particular, if you

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create and populate the new database.</strong>
          Now run the utility <span class="code">wee_config_database</span>

          if you are using SQLite, <span class="code">weewx_new</span> if you
          are using MySQL), using the schema found in

    <h1 id="porting">Porting to new hardware</h1>
      <p>Naturally, this is an advanced topic but, nevertheless, I'd
        like to encourage any Python wizards out there to give it a try. Of
        course, I have selfish reasons for this: I don't want to
        have to buy every weather station ever invented, and I don't want
        my roof to look like a weather station farm!</p>
      <p>Here's the general strategy for doing a port.</p>
      <h2>Implement the driver</h2>
      <p>Inherit from the abstract base class
        <span class="code">weewx.drivers.AbstractDevice</span>.
        Try to implement as many of its methods as you can. At the
        very minimum, you must implement the first three
        methods, <span class="code">loader</span>,
        <span class="code">hardware_name</span>,
        and <span class="code">genLoopPackets</span>. </p>
      <h3><span class="code">loader</span></h3>
      <p>This is a factory function that returns an instance of your
        driver. It has two arguments: the configuration dictionary,
        and a reference to the weewx engine.</p>
      <h3><span class="code">hardware_name</span></h3>
      <p>Return a string with a short nickname for the hardware, such
        as <span class="code">"ACME X90"</span></p>
      <h3><span class="code">genLoopPackets</span></h3>
      <p>This should be
        a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator
        function</a> that yields loop packets, one after
        another. Don't worry about stopping it: the engine will do
        this when an archive record is due. A "loop packet" is a
        dictionary. At the very minimum it must contain keys for the
        observation time and for the units used within the packet.</p>
      <table class="indent" style="width: 60%">
        <caption>Required keys</caption>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">dateTime</td>
            <td>The time of the observation in unix epoch time.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="code first_col">usUnits</td>
            <td>The unit system used. <span class="code">weewx.US</span> for US
              customary, <span class="code">weewx.METRICWX</span>, or 
              <span class="code">weewx.METRIC</span> for metric. See
              the file <span class="code">units.py</span>, dictionaries <span
                class="code">USUnits</span>, <span class="code">MetricWXUnits</span>,
              and <span class="code">MetricUnits</span>
              for the exact definition of each.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Then include any observation types you have in the dictionary. Every
        packet need not contain the same set of observation types. Different
        packets can use different unit systems, but all observations within a
        packet must use the same unit system. If your hardware has an error and
        you don't have a value, you can either leave it out of the dictionary or
        (preferred) set its value to <span class="code">None</span>.</p>
      <p>A couple of observation types are tricky. In particular, <span class="code">rain</span>.
        Generally, <span class="code">weewx</span> expects to see a packet with
        the amount of rain that fell in that packet period included as
        observation <span class="code">rain</span>. It then sums up all the
        values to get the total rainfall and emits that in the archive record.
        If your hardware does not provide this value, you might have to infer
        it from changes in whatever value it provides, for example changes in
        the daily or monthly rainfall. I know this is not the best solution,
        but it is the most general solution. Any alternatives are welcome!</p>
      <p>Wind is another tricky one. It is actually broken up into four
        different observations: <span class="code">windSpeed</span>,
        <span class="code">windDir</span>,
        <span class="code">windGust</span>, and
        <span class="code">windGustDir</span>.
        Supply as many as you can. The directions should be compass directions
        in degrees (0=North, 90=East, etc.).</p>
      <p>Be careful when reporting pressure. There are three observations
        related to pressure. Some stations report only the station pressure,
        others calculate and report sea level pressures. </p>

      <h3><span class="code">genArchiveRecords()</span></h3>
      <p>If your hardware does not have an archive record logger,
        then <span class="code">weewx</span> can do the record
        generation for you. It will automatically collect all the
        types it sees in your loop packets then emit a record with the
        averages (in some cases the sum or max value) of all those
        types. If it doesn't see a type, then it won't appear in the
        emitted record.</p>
        <p>However, if your hardware does have a logger, then you
        should implement method
        <span class="code">genArchiveRecords()</span> as well. It should
        be a generator function that returns all the records since a
        given time. </p>
        
      <h3><span class="code">archive_interval</span></h3>
      <p>If you implement function <span class="code">genArchiveRecords()</span>
      above, then you should also implement <span class='code'>archive_interval</span>
      as either an attribute, or as a <a
        href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property">property
        function</a>. It should return the archive
      interval in seconds.</p>
      
      <h3><span class="code">getTime()</span></h3>
      <p>If your hardware has an onboard clock and supports reading
        the time from it, then you may want to implement this
        method. It takes no argument. It should return the time in
        Unix Epoch Time. </p>

      <h3><span class="code">setTime()</span></h3>
      <p>If your hardware has an onboard clock and supports <em>setting</em>
        it, then you may want to implement this method.  It takes no
        argument and does not need to return anything.</p>

      <h3><span class="code">closePort()</span></h3>
      <p>If the driver needs to close a serial port, terminate a
        thread, close a database, or perform any other activity before
        the application terminates, then you must supply this
        function. <span class='code'>Weewx</span> will call it if it
        needs to shut down your console (usually in the case of an
        error).</p>

      <h2>Define the configuration</h2>
      <p>You then include a new section in the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
        that includes any options your driver needs. It should also include an
        entry <span class="code">driver</span> that points to where your
        driver can be found. Set option <span class="code">station_type</span>
        to your new section type and your driver will be loaded.</p>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>Before starting, take a look at the simulator code
        in <span class='code'>bin/weewx/drivers/simulator.py</span>. It's
        dirt simple and you can easily play with it. Many people have
        successfully used it as a starting point for writing their own
        custom driver.</p>
      <p>The next most complicated is the
        driver for the WMR100 series, located in <span class="code">wmr100.py</span>.
        It reads from a USB port and has to do some tricky buffer decoding. Nevertheless,
        it's general architecture is fairly straightforward.</p>
      <p>The driver for the Vantage series is by far the most complicated. It
        actually multi-inherits from not only <span class="code">AbstractDevice</span>,
        but also <span class="code">StdService</span>. That is, it also
        participates in the engine as a service.</p>
      <p>Naturally, there are a lot of subtleties that I've glossed over in this
        high-level description. If you're game, give it a try — I'm happy to
        help you out!</p>

      <h1 id="extensions">Extensions</h1>
      <p>Now that you have made some customizations, you might want to share
        those changes with other <span class='code'>weewx</span> users.  Put
        your customizations into an extension to make installation, removal,
        and distribution easier.</p>
      <p>Customizations typically fall into one of these categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>search list extension</li>
        <li>template</li>
        <li>skin</li>
        <li>service</li>
        <li>generator</li>
        <li>driver</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Extensions are a way to package one or more customizations so they
        can be installed and distributed as a functional group.</p>

      <h2>Extension guidelines</h2>
      <p>Here are a few guidelines for creating extensions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extensions should not modify or depend upon existing skins.
          An extension should include its own, standalone skin to illustrate
          any templates, search list extension, or generator features.</li>
        <li>Extensions should not modify the database schemas.
          If it requires data not found in the default databases, an
          extension should provide its own database and schema.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to package an extension</h2>
      <p>The structure of an extension mirrors that of
        <span class='code'>weewx</span> itself.  If the customizations include
        a skin, the extension will have a skins directory.  If the
        customizations include python code, the extension will have a
        <span class='code'>bin/user</span> directory.
      </p>
      <p>Each extension should also include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class='code'>readme.txt</span> - a summary of
          what the extension does, list of pre-requisites (if any), and
          instructions for installing the extension manually</li>
        <li><span class='code'>changelog</span> - an enumeration of
          changes in each release</li>
        <li><span class='code'>install.py</span> - python code used by the
          <span class='code'>weewx</span> ExtensionInstaller</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, here is the structure of a skin called
        <span class='code'>basic</span>:</p>
      <p class='tty'>basic/
basic/changelog
basic/install.py
basic/readme.txt
basic/skins/
basic/skins/basic/
basic/skins/basic/basic.css
basic/skins/basic/current.inc
basic/skins/basic/favicon.ico
basic/skins/basic/hilo.inc
basic/skins/basic/index.html.tmpl
basic/skins/basic/skin.conf</p>
      <p>Here is the structure of a search list extension called
        <span class='code'>xstats</span>:</p>
      <p class='tty'>xstats/
xstats/changelog
xstats/install.py
xstats/readme.txt
xstats/bin/
xstats/bin/user/
xstats/bin/user/xstats.py</p>
      <p>See the <span class='code'>extensions</span> directory of the
        <span class='code'>weewx</span> source for examples.</p>
      <p>To distribute an extension, simply create a compressed archive
        of the extension directory.</p>
      <p>For example, create the compressed archive for the
        <span class='code'>basic</span> skin like this:</p>
      <p class='tty'>tar cvfz basic.tar.gz basic</p>

      <h2>The extension (un)installer</h2>
      <p>The ExtensionInstaller is built in to
        <span class='code'>setup.py</span>.  It can install new extensions,
        uninstall installed extensions, or enumerate installed extensions.</p>
      <p>To install an extension:</p>
      <p class='tty'>./setup.py install --extension extensions/basic
./setup.py install --extension basic.tar.gz</p>
      <p>To uninstall an extension:</p>
      <p class='tty'>./setup.py uninstall --extension basic</p>
      <p>To list installed extensions:</p>
      <p class='tty'>./setup.py list-extensions</p>
      <p>Other options:</p>
      <p class='tty'>./setup.py --help --extension
Usage: setup.py install --extension (filename|directory)
                uninstall --extension extension_name
                list-extensions

install/remove/list extensions to weewx

Options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --extension=EXT  extension name, archive file, or directory
  --layout=LAYOUT  layout is deb, rpm, or py
  --tmpdir=DIR     temporary directory
  --dry-run        print what would happen but do not do it
  --verbosity=N    how much status to spew, 0-3</p>
      <p>The ExtensionInstaller will make only the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modifications to <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span></li>
        <li>Add/Remove directories in <span class='code'>skins</span></li>
        <li>Add/Remove directories in <span class='code'>user</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ExtensionInstaller makes a copy of any file or directory that it
        modifies or replaces.</p>
      <p>If <span class='code'>weewx</span> was installed using
        <span class='code'>setup.py</span>,
        the ExtensionInstaller depends upon 
        <span class='code'>setup.cfg</span> to locate the
        <span class='code'>weewx</span> installation.  If
        <span class='code'>weewx</span> was installed using a DEB or RPM
        package,
        <span class='code'>setup.cfg</span> is not used.</p>
      <p>The ExtensionInstaller creates a directory called
        <span class='code'>installer</span> in the
        <span class='code'>user</span> directory.  The contents of the
        <span class='code'>installer</span> directory are
        used to enumerate and uninstall extensions.</p>

      <h1 id="archive_types">Appendix: Archive Types</h1>
      <p><em>Archive types</em> are weather observations that have come from
        your instrument and been stored in the <em>archive database</em>, a SQL
        database. They represent the <em>current conditions</em> as of some
        time. They are available to be used in two places: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In your template files as a tag with period <span class="code">$current</span>.
          Hence, the tag <span class="code">$current.outTemp</span> represents
          the latest current outside temperature. There is no aggregation
          involved (see <a href="#statistical_types">statistical types</a> for
          aggregation). </li>
        <li>In your plot graphs. Here, a line in the graph represents the set of
          current observations over a time period. While each plot point in a
          graph may represent an aggregation, do not confuse this aggregation
          with the statistical aggregation. The former is done with the archive
          database, the latter with the statistical database. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following table shows all the possible archive types and whether
        they can be used in tag <span class="code">$current</span> or in a
        plot. Note that just because a type appears in the table does not
        necessarily mean that it is available for <em>your</em> station setup.
        That would depend on whether your instrument supports the type. </p>
