weewx change history
--------------------

2.6.0 MM/DD/YY

Changed the RESTful architecture so RESTful services are now first-class
weewx services. This should simplify the installation of 3rd party
extensions that use these services.

Broke up service_list, the very long list of services to be run, into
five separate lists. This will allow services to be grouped together,
according to when they should be run.

Changed the default time and date labels to use locale dependent formatting.
The defaults should now work in most locales, provided you set the
environment variable LANG before running weewx.


2.5.1 12/30/13

Added UV plots to the templates. They will be shown automatically if you
have any UV data.

Fixed bug when reading cooling_base option.

Default to sane behavior if skin does not define Labels.

Fixed bug in setting of CheetahGenerator options.

Fixed qsf and qpf summary values in forecast module.

Fixed handling of empty sky cover fields in WU forecasts.

Forecast module now considers the fctcode, condition, and wx fields for
precipitation and obstructions to visibility.

Added options to forecast module to help diagnose parsing failures and new
forecast formats.

Added retries when saving forecast to database and when reading from database.

Fixes to the Fine Offset driver to eliminate spikes caused by reading from
memory before the pointer had been updated (not the same thing as an unstable
read).

Added driver for LaCrosse 2300 series of weather stations.

Added driver for Hideki TE923 series of weather stations.


2.5.0 10/29/13

Introduced a new architecture that makes it easier to define search
list extensions. The old architecture should be 100% backwards compatible.

Added station registry service. This allows weewx to optionally
"phone home" and put your station location on a map.

Added a forecast service and reporting options.  The forecast service
can generate Zambretti weather or XTide tide forecasts, or it can download
Weather Underground or US National Weather Service weather forecasts.  These
data can then be displayed in reports using the Cheetah template engine.  The
forecast service is disabled by default.

Weewx now allows easier localization to non-English speaking locales.
In particular, set the environment variable LANG to your locale, and
then weewx date and number formatting will follow local conventions.
There are also more labeling options in skin.conf. Details in a new section
in the Customization Guide.

Added aggregate type "minmax" and "maxmin". Thank you user Gary Roderick!

New option in [StdArchive] called "loop_hilo". Setting to True will
cause both LOOP and archive data to be used for high/low statistics.
This is the default. Setting to False causes only archive data to be used.

When a template fails, skip only that template, not everything that the
generator is processing.

Trend calculations no longer need a record at precisely (for example)
3 hours in the past. It can be within a "grace" period.

FineOffset driver now uses the 'delay' field instead of the fixed_block
'read_period' for the archive record interval when reading records from
console memory.

FineOffset driver now support for multiple stations on the same USB.

FineOffset driver now reduces logging verbosity when bad magic numbers
appear. Log only when the numbers are unrecognized or change.
The purpose of the magic numbers is still unknown.

WMR100, Vantage, FineOffset, and WS28xx drivers now emit a null wind
direction when the wind speed is zero.  Same for wind gust.

For WMR9x8 stations, wind chill is now retrieved from the console
rather than calculated in software. Thank you user Peter Ferencz!

For WMR9x8 stations, the first extra temperature sensor (packet code 4)
now shows up as extraTemp1 (instead of outTemp). Thanks again to 
Peter Ferencz.

For WMR9x8 stations, packet types 2 and 3 have been separated. Only the
latter is used for outside temperature, humidity, dewpoint. The former
is used for "extra" sensors. Corrected the calculation for channel
numbers >=3. Also, extended the number of battery codes. Thanks to Per
Edström for his patience in figuring this out!

For WMR200 stations, altitude-corrected pressure is now emitted correctly.

ws28xx driver improvements, including: better thread control; better logging
for debugging/diagnostics; better timing to reduce dropouts; eliminate writes
to disk to reduce wear when used on flash devices. Plus, support for
multiple stations on the same USB.

Fixed rain units in ws28xx driver.

The LOOP value for daily ET on Vantages was too high by a factor of 10. 
This has been corrected.

Fixed a bug that caused values of ET to be miscalculated when using
software record generation.

Ported to Korora 19 (Fedora 19). Thanks to user zmodemguru!

Plots under 16 hours in length, now use 1 hour increments (instead of 
3 hours).

No longer emits "deprecation" warning when working with some versions
of the MySQLdb python driver.

Added ability to build platform-specific RPMs, e.g., one for RedHat-based
distributions and one for SuSE-based distributions.

Fixed the 'stop' and 'restart' options in the SuSE rc script.

The weewx logwatch script now recognizes more log entries and errors.


2.4.0 08/03/13

The configuration utility wee_config_vantage now allows you to set
DST to 'auto', 'off', or 'on'. It also lets you set either a time
zone code, or a time zone offset.

The service StdTimeSync now catches startup events and syncs the clock
on them. It has now been moved to the beginning of the list
"service_list" in weewx.conf. Users may want to do the same with their
old configuration file.

A new event, END_ARCHIVE_PERIOD has been added, signaling the end of
the archive period.

The LOOP packets emitted by the driver for the Davis Vantage series
now includes the max wind gust and direction seen since the beginning
of the current archive period.

Changed the null value from zero (which the Davis documentation specifies)
to 0x7fff for the VP2 type 'highRadiation'.

Archive record packets with date and time equal to zero or 0xff now
terminate dumps.

The code that picks a filename for "summary by" reports has now been
factored out into a separate function (getSummaryByFileName). This
allows the logic to be changed by subclassing.

Fixed a bug that did not allow plots with aggregations less than 60 minutes
across a DST boundary.

Fixed bug in the WMR100 driver that prevented UV indexes from being 
reported.

The driver for the LaCrosse WS-28XX weather series continues to evolve and
mature. However, you should still consider it experimental.


2.3.3 06/21/13

The option week_start now works.

Updated WMR200 driver from Chris Manton.

Fixed bug that prevented queries from being run against a MySQL database.


2.3.2 06/16/13

Added support for the temperature-only sensor THWR800. Thanks to
user fstuyk!

Fixed bug that prevented overriding the FTP directory in section
[[FTP]] of the configuration file.

Day plots now show 24 hours instead of 27. If you want the old
behavior, then change option "time_length" to 97200.

Plots shorter than 24 hours are now possible. Thanks to user Andrew Tridgell.

If one of the sections SummaryByMonth, SummaryByYear, or ToDate is missing,
the report engine no longer crashes.

If you live at a high latitude and the sun never sets, the Almanac now
does the right thing.

Fixed bug that caused the first day in the stats database to be left out
of calculations of all-time stats.


2.3.1 04/15/13

Fixed bug that prevented Fine Offset stations from downloading archive
records if the archive database had no records in it.

rsync should now work with Python 2.5 and 2.6 (not just 2.7)


2.3.0 04/10/13

Davis Vantage stations can now produce station pressures (aka, "absolute
pressure"), altimeter pressures, as well as sea-level pressure. These will
be put in the archive database.

Along the same line, 'altimeter' pressure is now reported to CWOP, rather
than the 'barometer' pressure. If altimeter pressure is not available,
no pressure is reported.

Fixed bug in CWOP upload that put spaces in the upload string if the pressure
was under 1000 millibars.

A bad record archive type now causes a catch up to be abandoned, rather
than program termination.

Fixed bug in trends, when showing changes in temperature. NB: this fix will
not work with explicit unit conversion. I.e., $trend.outTemp.degree_C will
not work.

Modified wee_config_vantage and wee_config_fousb so that the configuration
file will be guessed if none is specified.

Fixed wxformulas.heatindexC to handle arguments of None type.

Fixed bug that causes Corrections to be applied twice to archive records if
software record generation is used.

rsync now allows a port to be specified.

Fixed day/night transition bug.

Added gradients to the day/night transitions.

Numerous fixes to the WMR200 driver. Now has a "watchdog" thread.

All of the device drivers have now been put in their own package
'weewx.drivers' to keep them together. Many have also had name changes
to make them more consistent:
	OLD                        NEW
	VantagePro.py (Vantage)    vantage.py (Vantage)
	WMR918.py     (WMR-918)    wmr9x8.py  (WMR9x8)
	wmrx.py       (WMR-USB)    wmr100.py  (WMR100)
	
	new (experimental) drivers:
	wmr200.py (WMR200)
	ws28xx.py (WS28xx)

The interface to the device driver "loader" function has changed slightly. It
now takes a second parameter, "engine". Details are in the Upgrading doc.

The FineOffsetUSB driver now supports hardware archive record generation.

When starting weewx, the FineOffsetUSB driver will now try to 'catch up' - it
will read the console memory for any records that are not yet in the database.

Added illuminance-to-radiation conversion in FineOffsetUSB driver.

Added pressure calibration option to wee_config_fousb and explicit support for
pressure calibration in FineOffsetUSB driver.

Fixed windchill calculation in FineOffsetUSB driver.

Fixed FineOffsetUSB driver to handle cases where the 'delay' is undefined,
resulting in a TypeError that caused weewx to stop.

The FineOffsetUSB driver now uses 'max_rain_rate' (measured in cm/hr) instead
of 'max_sane_rain' (measured in mm) to filter spurious rain sensor readings.
This is done in the driver instead of StdQC so that a single parameter can
apply to both LOOP and ARCHIVE records.

2.2.1 02/15/13

Added a function call to the Vantage driver that allows the lamp to be
turned on and off. Added a corresponding option to wee_config_vantage.

Fixed bug where an undefined wind direction caused an exception when using
ordinal wind directions.

2.2.0 02/14/13

Weewx can now be installed using Debian (DEB) or Redhat (RPM) packages, as well
as with the old 'setup.py' method. Because they install things in different
places, you should stick with one method or another. Don't mix and match.
Thanks to Matthew Wall for putting this together!

Added plot options line_gap_fraction and bar_gap_fraction, which control how
gaps in the data are handled by the plots. Also, added more flexible control of
plot colors, using a notation such as 0xBBGGRR, #RRGGBB, or the English name,
such as 'yellow'. Finally, added day/night bands to the plots. All contributed
by Matthew Wall. Thanks again, Matthew!

Ordinal wind directions can now be shown, just by adding the tag suffix
".ordinal_compass". For example, $current.windDir.ordinal_compass might show
'SSE' The abbreviations are set in the skin configuration file.

Fixed bug that caused rain totals to be misreported to Weather Underground when
using a metric database.

Generalized the weewx machinery so it can be used for applications other than
weather applications.

Got rid of option stats_types in weewx.conf and put it in
bin/user/schemas.py. See upgrading.html if you have a specialized stats
database.

The stats database now includes an internal table of participating observation
types. This allows it to be easily combined with the archive database, should
you choose to do so. The table is automatically created for older stats
databases.

Added rain rate calculation to FineOffsetUSB driver.  Added adaptive polling
option to FineOffsetUSB driver.  Fixed barometric pressure calculation for
FineOffsetUSB driver.

Changed the name of the utilities, so they will be easier to find in /usr/bin:
  weewxd.py          -> weewxd
  runreports.py      -> wee_reports
  config_database.py -> wee_config_database
  config_vp.py       -> wee_config_vantage
  config_fousb.py    -> wee_config_fousb

2.1.1 01/02/13

Fixed bug that shows itself when one of the variables is 'None' when
calculating a trend.

2.1.0 01/02/13

Now supports the Oregon Scientific WMR918/968 series, courtesy of user
William Page. Thanks, William!!

Now supports the Fine Offset series of weather stations, thanks to user
Matthew Wall. Thanks, Matthew!!

Now includes a Redhat init.d script, contributed by Mark Jenks. Thanks,
Mark!!

Added rsync report type as an alternative to the existing FTP report.
Another thanks to William Page!

Fill color for bar charts can now be specified separately from the outline
color, resulting in much more attractive charts. Another thanks to Matthew
Wall!!

Added a tag for trends. The barometer trend can now be returned as
$trend.barometer. Similar syntax for other observation types.

config_vp.py now returns the console version number if available (older
consoles do not offer this).

Hardware dewpoint calculations with the WMR100 seem to be unreliable below
about 20F, so these are now done in software. Thanks to user Mark Jenks for
sleuthing this.

2.0.2 11/23/12

Now allows both the archive and stats data to be held in the same database.

Improved chances of weewx.Archive being reused by allowing optional table
name to be specified.

2.0.1 11/05/12

Fixed problem with reconfiguring databases to a new unit system.

2.0.0 11/04/12

A big release with lots of changes. The two most important are the support
of additional weather hardware, and the support of the MySQL database.

All skin configurations are backwardly compatible, but the configuration
file, weewx.conf, is not. The install utility setup.py will install a fresh
version, which you will then have to edit by hand.

If you have written a custom service, see the upgrade guide on how to port
your service to the new architecture.

Added the ability to generate archive records in software, thus opening the
door for supporting weather stations that do not have a logger.

Support for the Oregon Scientific WMR100, the cheapest weather station I
could find, in order to demonstrate the above!

Added a software weather station simulator.

Introduced weedb, a database-independent Python wrapper around sqlite3 and
MySQLdb, which fixes some of their flaws.

Ported everything to use weedb, and thus MySQL (as well as sqlite)

Internally, the databases can now use either Metric units, or US Customary.
NB: you cannot switch systems in the middle of a database. You have to
stick to one or other other. However, the utility config_database.py does
have a reconfigure option that allows copying the data to a new database,
performing the conversion along the way. See the Customizing Guide.

You can now use "mmHg" as a unit of pressure.

Added new almanac information, such as first and last quarter moons, and
civil twilight.

Changed the engine architecture so it is more event driven. It now uses
callbacks, making it easier to add new event types.

Added utility config_vp.py, for configuring the VantagePro hardware.

Added utility config_database.py, for configuring the databases.

Made it easier to write custom RESTful protocols. Thanks to user Brad, for
the idea and the use case!

The stats type 'squarecount' now contains the number of valid wind
directions that went into calculating 'xsum' and 'ysum'. It used to be the
number of valid wind speeds. Wind direction is now calculated using
'squarecount' (instead of 'count').

Simplified and reduced the memory requirements of the CRC16 calculations.

Improved test suites.

Lots of little nips and tucks here and there, mostly to reduce the coupling
between different modules. In particular, now a service generally gets
configured only using its section of weewx.conf.

I also worked hard at making sure that cursors, connections, files, and
lots of other bits and pieces get properly closed instead of relying on
garbage collection. Hopefully, this will reduce the long-term growth of
memory usage.

1.14.1 07/06/12

Hardened retry strategy for the WeatherLink IP. If the port fails to open
at all, or a socket error occurs, it will thrown an exception (resulting in
a retry in 60 seconds). If a socket returns an incomplete result, it will
continue to retry until everything has been read.

Fixed minor bug that causes the reporting thread to prematurely terminate
if an exception is thrown while doing an FTP.

1.14.0 06/18/12

Added smartphone formatted mobile webpage, contributed by user Torbjörn
Einarsson. If you are doing a fresh install, then these pages will be
generated automatically. If you are doing an upgrade, then see the upgrade
guide on how to have these webpages generated. Thanks, Tobbe!

Three changes suggested by user Charlie Spirakis: o Changed umask in
daemon.py to 0022; o Allow location of process ID file to be specified on
the command line of weewx; o Start script allows daemon to be run as a
specific user. Thanks, Charlie!

Corrected bug in humidity reports to CWOP that shows itself when the
humidity is in the single digits.

Now includes software in CWOP APRS equipment field.

1.13.2 05/02/12

Now allows CWOP stations with prefix 'EW'.

Fixed bug that showed itself in the line color with plots with 3 or more
lines.

Changed debug message when reaching the end of memory in the VP2 to
something slightly less alarming.

1.13.1 03/25/12

Added finer control over the line plots. Can now add optional markers. The
marker_type can be 'none' (the default), 'cross', 'box', 'circle', or 'x'.
Also, line_type can now either be 'solid' (the default) or 'none' (for
scatter plots). Same day I'll add 'dashed', but not now. :-)

Conditionally imports sqlite3. If it does not support the "with" statement,
then imports pysqlite2 as sqlite3.

1.13.0 03/13/12

The binding to the SQL database to be used now happens much later when
running reports. This allows more than one database to be used when running
a report. Extra databases can be specified in the option list for a report.
I use this to display broadband bandwidth information, which was collected
by a separate program. Email me for details on how to do this. Introducing
this feature changed the signature of a few functions. See the upgrade
guide for details.

1.12.4 02/13/12

User Alf Høgemark found an error in the encoding of solar data for CWOP
and sent me a fix. Thanks, Alf!

Now always uses "import sqlite3", resulting in using the version of
pysqlite that comes with Python. This means the install instructions have
been simplified.

Now doesn't choke when using the (rare) Python version of NameMapper used
by Cheetah.

1.12.3 02/09/12

Added start script for FreeBSD, courtesy of user Fabian Abplanalp. Thanks,
Fabian!

Added the ability to respond to a "status" query to the Debian startup
script.

RESTful posts can now recover from more HTTP errors.

Station serial port can now recover from a SerialException error (usually
caused when there is a process competing for the serial port).

Continue to fiddle with the retry logic when reading LOOP data.

1.12.2 01/18/12

Added check for FTP error code '521' to the list of possibilities if a
directory already exists. Thanks to user Clyde!

More complete information when unable to load a module file. Thanks, Jason!

Added a few new unit types to the list of possible target units when using
explicit conversion. Thanks, Antonio!

Discovered and fixed problem caused by the Davis docs giving the wrong
"resend" code (should be decimal 21, not hex 21).

Improved robustness of VantagePro configuration utility.

Fixed problem where an exception gets thrown when changing VP archive
interval.

Simplified some of the logic in the VP2 driver.

1.12.1 11/03/11

Now corrects for rain bucket size if it is something other than the
standard 0.01 inch bucket.

1.12.0 10/29/11

Added the ability to change bucket type, rain year start, and barometer
calibration data in the console using the utility configure.py. Added
option "--info", which queries the console and returns information about
EEPROM settings. Changed configure.py so it can do hardware-specific
configurations, in anticipation of supporting hardware besides the Davis
series.

Reorganized the documentation.

1.11.0 10/06/11

Added support for the Davis WeatherLinkIP. Thanks, Peter Nock and Travis
Pickle!

Added support for older Rev A type archive records.

Added patch from user Dan Haller that sends UV and radiation data to the
WeatherUnderground if available. Thanks, Dan!

Added patch from user Marijn Vriens that allows fallback to the version of
pysqlite that comes with many versions of Python. Thanks, Marijn!

Now does garbage collection after an archive record is obtained and before
the main loop is restarted.

1.10.2 04/14/11

Added RA and declination for the Sun and Moon to the Daily Almanac. Equinox
and solstice are now displayed in chronological order. Same with new and
full moons.

Examples alarm.py and lowBattery.py now include more error checks, allow an
optional 'subject' line to the sent email, and allow a comma separated list
of recipients.

1.10.1 03/30/11

Substitutes US Units if a user does not specify anything (instead of
exception KeyError).

Almanac uses default temperature and pressure if they are 'None'.

Prettied up web page almanac data in the case where pyephem has not been
installed.

Fixed up malformed CSS script weewx.css.

1.10.0 03/29/11

Added extensive almanac information if the optional package 'pyephem' has
been installed

Added a weewx "favorite icon" favicon.ico that displays in your browser
toolbar.

Added a mobile formatted HTML page, courtesy of user Vince Skahan (thanks,
Vince!!).

Tags can now be ended with a unit type to convert to a new unit. For
example, say your pressure group ("group_pressure") has been set to show
inHg. The normal tag notation of "$day.barometer.avg" will show something
like "30.05 inHg". However, the tag "$day.barometer.avg.mbar" will show
"1017.5 mbar".

Added special tag "exists" to test whether an observation type exists.
Example "$year.foo.exists" will return False if there is no type "foo" in
the statistical database.

Added special tag "has_data" to test whether an observation type exists and
has a non-zero number of data points over the aggregation period. For
example, "$year.soilMoist1.has_data" will return "True" if soilMoist1 both
exists in the stats database and contains some data (meaning, you have the
hardware).

Y-axis plot labels (such as "°F") can now be overridden in the plot
configuration section of skin.conf by using option "y_label".

Added executable module "runreports.py" for running report generation only.

Added package "user", which can contain any user extensions. This package
will not get overridden in the upgrade process.

Added the ability to reconfigure the main database, i.e., add or drop data
types. Along the same line, statistical types can also be added or dropped.
Email me for details on how to do this.

Now makes all of the LOOP and archive data available to services. This
includes new keys:

 LOOP data: 'extraAlarm1' 'extraAlarm2' 'extraAlarm3' 'extraAlarm4'
'extraAlarm5' 'extraAlarm6' 'extraAlarm7' 'extraAlarm8' 'forecastIcon'
'forecastRule' 'insideAlarm' 'outsideAlarm1' 'outsideAlarm2' 'rainAlarm'
'soilLeafAlarm1' 'soilLeafAlarm2' 'soilLeafAlarm3' 'soilLeafAlarm4'
'sunrise' 'sunset'

 Archive data: 'forecastRule' 'highOutTemp' 'highRadiation' 'highUV'
'lowOutTemp'

Started a more formal test suite. There are now tests for the report
generators. These are not included in the normal distribution, but can be
retrieved from SourceForge via svn.

1.9.3 02/04/11

Now correctly decodes temperatures from LOOP packets as signed shorts
(rather than unsigned).

Now does a CRC check on LOOP data.

Changed VantagePro.accumulateLoop to make it slightly more robust.

1.9.2 11/20/10

Now catches exception of type OverflowError when calculating celsius
dewpoint. (Despite the documentation indicating otherwise, math.log() can
still throw an OverflowError)

Fixed bug that causes crash in VantagePro.accumulateLoop() during fall DST
transition in certain situations.

VP2 does not store records during the one hour fall DST transition.
Improved logic in dealing with this.

Changed install so that it backs up the ./bin subdirectory, then overwrites
the old one. Also, does not install the ./skins subdirectory at all if one
already exists (thus preserving any user customization).

1.9.1 09/09/10

Now catches exceptions of type httplib.BadStatusLine when doing RESTful
posts.

Added an extra decimal point of precision to dew point reports to the
Weather Underground and PWS.

1.9.0 07/04/10

Added a new service, StdQC, that offers a rudimentary data check.

Corrected error in rain year total if rain year does not start in January.

Moved option max_drift (the max amount of clock drift to tolerate) to
section [Station].

Added check for a bad storm start time.

Added checks for bad dateTime.

Simplified VantagePro module.

1.8.4 06/06/10

Fixed problem that shows itself if weewx starts up at precisely the
beginning of an archive interval. Symptom is max recursion depth exceeded.

Units for UV in LOOP records corrected. Also, introduced new group for UV,
group_uv_index. Thanks to user A. Burriel for this fix!

1.8.3 05/20/10

Problem with configuring archive interval found and fixed by user A.
Burriel (thanks, Antonio!)

1.8.2 05/09/10

Added check to skip calibration for a type that doesn't exist in LOOP or
archive records. This allows windSpeed and windGust to be calibrated
separately.

1.8.1 05/01/10

Ported to Cheetah V2.4.X

1.8.0 04/28/10

Added CWOP support.

Storage of LOOP and archive data into the SQL databases is now just another
service, StdArchive.

Added a calibration service, StdCalibrate, that can correct LOOP and
archive data.

Average console battery voltage is now calculated from LOOP data, and saved
to the archive as 'consBatteryVoltage'.

Transmitter battery status is now ORd together from LOOP data, and saved to
the archive as 'txBatteryStatus'.

Added stack tracebacks for unrecoverable exceptions.

Added a wrapper to the serial port in the VantagePro code. When used in a
Python "with" statement, it automatically releases the serial port if an
exception happens, allowing a more orderly shutdown.

Offered some hints in the documentation on how to automount your VP2 when
using a USB connection.

Corrected error in units. getTargetType() that showed itself with when the
console memory was freshly cleared, then tried to graph something
immediately.

1.7.0 04/15/10

Big update.

Reports now use skins for their "look or feel." Options specific to the
presentation layer have been moved out of the weewx configuration file
'weewx.conf' to a skin configuration file, 'skin.conf'. Other options have
remained behind.

Because the configuration file weewx.conf was split, the installation
script setup.py will NOT merge your old configuration file into the new
one. You will have to reedit weewx.conf to put in your customizations.

FTP is treated as just another report, albeit with an unusual generator.
You can have multiple FTP sessions, each to a different server, or
uploading to or from a different area.

Rewrote the FTP upload package so that it allows more than one FTP session
to be active in the same local directory. This version also does fewer hits
on the server, so it is significantly faster.

The configuration files weewx.conf and skin.conf now expect UTF-8
characters throughout.

The encoding for reports generated from templates can be chosen. By
default, the day, week, month, and year HTML files are encoded using HTML
entities; the NOAA reports encoded using 'strict ascii.' Optionally,
reports can be encoded using UTF-8.

Revamped the template formatting. No longer use class ModelView. Went to a
simpler system built around classes ValueHelper and UnitInfo.

Optional formatting was added to all tags in the templates. There are now
optional endings: 'string': Use specified string for None value.
'formatted': No label. 'format': Format using specified string format.
'nolabel': Format using specified string format; no label. 'raw': return
the underlying data with no string formatting or label.

For the index, week, month, and year template files, added conditional to
not include ISS extended types (UV, radiation, ET) unless they exist.

Added an RSS feed.

Added support for PWSweather.com

Both WeatherUnderground and PWSweather posts are now retried up to 3 times
before giving up.

Now offer a section 'Extras' in the skin configuration file for including
tags added by the user. As an example, the tag radar_url has been moved
into here.

Data files used in reports (such as weewx.css) are copied over to the HTML
directory on program startup.

Included an example of a low-battery alarm.

Rearranged distribution directory structure so that it matches the install
directory structure.

Moved base temperature for heating and cooling degree days into skin.conf.
They now also require a unit.

Now require unit to be specified for 'altitude'.

1.5.0 03/07/10

Added support for other units besides the U.S. Customary. Plots and HTML
reports can be prepared using any arbitrary combination of units. For
example, pressure could be in millibars, while everything else is in U.S.
Customary.

Because the configuration file weewx.conf changed significantly, the
installation script setup.py will NOT merge your old configuration file
into the new one. You will have to reedit weewx.conf to put in your
customizations.

Added an exception handler for exception OSError, which is typically thrown
when another piece of software attempts to access the same device port.
Weewx catches the exception, waits 10 seconds, then starts again from the
top.

1.4.0 02/22/10

Changed the architecture of stats.py to one that uses very late binding.
The SQL statements are not run until template evaluation. This reduces the
amount of memory required (by about 1/2), reduces memory fragmentation, as
well as greatly simplifying the code (file stats.py shed over 150 lines of
non-test code). Execution time is slightly slower for NOAA file generation,
slightly faster for HTML file generation, the same for image generation,
although your actual results will depend on your disk speed.

Now possible to tell weewx to reread the configuration file without
stopping it. Send signal HUP to the process.

Added option week_start, for specifying which day a calendar week starts
on. Default is 6 (Sunday).

Fixed reporting bug when the reporting time falls on a calendar month or
year boundary.

1.3.4 02/08/10

Fixed problem when plotting data where all data points are bad (None).

1.3.3 01/10/10

Fixed reporting bug that shows itself if rain year does not start in
January.

1.3.2 12/26/09

LOOP data added to stats database.

1.3.1 12/22/09

Added a call to syslog.openlog() that inadvertently got left out when
switching to the engine driven architecture.

1.3.0 12/21/09

Moved to a very different architecture to drive weewx. Consists of an
engine, that manages a list of 'services.' At key events, each service is
given a chance to participate. Services are easy to add, to allow easy
customization. An example is offered of an 'alarm' service.

Checking the clock of the weather station for drift is now a service, so
the option clock_check was moved from the station specific [VantagePro]
section to the more general [Station] section.

Added an example service 'MyAlarm', which sends out an email should the
outside temperature drop below 40 degrees.

In a similar manner, all generated files, images, and reports are the
product of a report engine, which can run any number of reports. New
reports are easily added.

Moved the compass rose used in progressive vector plots into the interior
of the plot.

Install now deletes public_html/#upstream.last, thus forcing all files to
be uploaded to the web server at the next opportunity.

1.2.0 11/22/09

Added progressive vector plots for wind data.

Improved axis scaling. The automatic axis scaling routine now does a better
job for ranges less than 1.0. The user can also hardwire in min and max
values, as well as specify a minimum increment, through parameter 'yscale'
in section [Images] in the configuration file.

Now allows the same SQL type to be used more than once in a plot. This
allows, say, instantaneous and average wind speed to be shown in the same
plot.

Rain year is now parameterized in file templates/year.tmpl (instead of
being hardwired in).

Now does LOOP caching by default.

When doing backfilling to the stats database, configure now creates the
stats database if it doesn't already exist.

setup.py now more robust to upgrading the FTP and Wunderground sections

1.1.0 11/14/09

Added the ability to cache LOOP data. This can dramatically reduce the
number of writes to the stats database, reducing wear on solid-state disk
stores.

Introduced module weewx.mainloop. Introduced class weewx.mainloop.MainLoop
This class offers many opportunities to customize weewx through
subclassing, then overriding an appropriate member function.

Refactored module weewx.wunderground so it more closely resembles the
(better) logic in wunderfixer.

setup.py no longer installs a daemon startup script to /etc/init.d. It must
now be done by hand.

setup.py now uses the 'home' value in setup.cfg to set WEEWX_ROOT in
weewx.conf and in the daemon start up scripts

Now uses FTP passive mode by default.

1.0.1 11/09/09

Fixed bug that prevented backfilling the stats database after modifying the
main archive.

1.0.0 10/26/09

Took the module weewx.factory back out, as it was too complicated and hard
to understand.

Added support for generating NOAA monthly and yearly reports. Completely
rewrote the filegenerator.py module, to allow easy subclassing and
specialization.

Completely rewrote the stats.py module. All aggregate quantities are now
calculated dynamically.

Labels for HTML generation are now held separately from labels used for
image generation. This allows entities such as '&deg;' to be used for the
former.

LOOP mode now requests only 200 LOOP records (instead of the old 2000). It
then renews the request should it run out. This was to get around an
(undocumented) limitation in the VP2 that limits the number of LOOP records
that can be requested to something like 220. This was a problem when
supporting VP2s that use long archive intervals.

Cut down the amount of computing that went on before the processing thread
was spawned, thus allowing the main thread to get back into LOOP mode more
quickly.

Added type 'rainRate' to the types decoded from a Davis archive record. For
some reason it was left out.

Added retries when doing FTP uploads. It will now attempt the upload
several times before giving up.

Much more extensive DEBUG analysis.

Nipped and tucked here and there, trying to simplify.

0.6.5 10/11/09

Ported to Cheetah V2.2.X. Mostly, this is making sure that all strings that
cannot be converted with the 'ascii' codec are converted to Unicode first
before feeding to Cheetah.

0.6.4 09/22/09

Fixed an error in the calculation of heat index.

0.6.3 08/25/09

FTP transfers now default to ACTIVE mode, but a configuration file option
allows PASSIVE mode. This was necessary to support Microsoft FTP servers.

0.6.2 08/01/09

Exception handling in weewx/ftpdata.py used socket.error but failed to
declare it. Added 'import socket' to fix.

Added more complete check for unused pages in weewx/VantagePro.py. Now the
entire record must be filled with 0xff, not just the time field. This fixes
a bug where certain time stamps could look like unused records.

0.6.1 06/22/09

Fixed minor ftp bug.

0.6.0 05/20/09

Changed the file, imaging, ftping functions into objects, so they can be
more easily specialized by the user.

Introduced a StationData object.

Introduced module weewx.factory that produces these things, so the user has
a place to inject his/her new types.

0.5.1 05/13/09

1. Weather Underground thread now run as daemon thread, allowing the
program to exit even if it is running.

2. WU queue now hold an instance of archive and the time to be published,
rather than a record. This allows dailyrain to be published as well.

3. WU date is now given in the format "2009-05-13+12%3A35%3A00" rather than
"2009-05-13 12:35:00". Seems to be more reliable. But, maybe I'm imagining
things...
