        <p>This document explains the three methods of upgrading:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Upgrading_using_setup.py">Upgrading using <span class='code'>setup.py</span></a></li>
            <li><a href="#Upgrading_using_DEB_package">Upgrading using DEB package</a></li>
            <li><a href="#Upgrading_using_RPM_package">Upgrading using RPM package</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The section <em><a href="#Instructions_for_specific_versions">Instructions for Specific Versions</a></em>
            describes changes required from one version to the next. These changes
            apply to every upgrade method.</p>

        <p class="warning"><strong>Warning!</strong><br/>
            You must use the same upgrade technique as your initial install!
            For example, if you used <span class="code">setup.py</span> to install
            weeWX, then you should use
            <span class="code">setup.py</span> to upgrade.
            If you used a DEB or RPM package to install, then you should upgrade
            using the same package type.
        </p>

        <h1><a name="Upgrading_using_setup.py">Upgrading using <span class='code'>setup.py</span></a></h1>

        <p>Before upgrading weeWX, check the section <em>
            <a href="#Instructions_for_specific_versions">Instructions for
                Specific Versions</a></em> to see if any specific
            actions are
            required. Then follow the standard installation procedure:</p>
        <p>Unpack the archive:</p>
        <pre class="tty cmd">tar xvfz weewx-X.Y.Z.tar.gz</pre>
        <p>Change directory into it:</p>
        <pre class="tty cmd">cd weewx-X.Y.Z </pre>
        <p>Build the distribution:</p>
        <pre class="tty cmd">./setup.py build </pre>

        <p>
          After checking <span class='code'>setup.cfg</span>, install your new
          version of <span class='code'>weewx</span>:</p>
        <p class='warning'><strong>Warning!</strong><br/>
            Before doing the next step, be sure that <span class="code">home</span>
            in the file <span class="code">setup.cfg</span> is set to the location
            of the previous weeWX installation.
        </p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">sudo ./setup.py install </pre>

        <p>The install process will do the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save the old <span class="code">bin</span> directory as
                <span class='code'>bin.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</span>
                where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is a timestamp
            </li>
            <li>Install the new version in the <span class="code">bin</span>
                directory, while preserving any user extensions in the
                <span class="code">bin/user</span> directory
            </li>
            <li>Save a copy of the old <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> as
                <span class='code'>weewx.conf.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</span>
            </li>
            <li>Merge any changes made to the old configuration file
                <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> into the new configuration
                file, then install the merged copy. This effectively causes any
                changes to override the values in the new version of
                <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            </li>
            <li>Install a <span class="code">skins</span> directory if
                one does not already exist.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1><a name="Upgrading_using_DEB_package">Upgrading using DEB package</a></h1>

        <p>If you have specified the weeWX apt repository in
            <span class="code">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/weewx.list</span>, then
            upgrade to the latest version like this:</p>

        <pre class='tty cmd'>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install weewx</pre>

        <p>Otherwise, download the latest X.Y.Z DEB package from the 
        <a href="http://weewx.com/downloads/">Download page</a> on weewx.com,
        then upgrade like this:</p>

        <pre class='tty cmd'>sudo dpkg -i weewx_X.Y.Z-R.deb</pre>

        <p>The upgrade process will not modify the weeWX databases.</p>

        <p>Unmodified files will be upgraded. If modifications have been made to
            the weeWX configuration, you will be prompted as to whether you want to
            keep the existing configuration or accept the new configuration. Either
            way, a copy of the option you did not choose will be saved.</p>

        <p>For example, if <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span> was
            modified, you will see a message something like this:</p>

        <pre class='tty'>Configuration file `/etc/weewx/weewx.conf'
  ==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
  ==&gt; Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
  What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
            Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
            N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
              D     : show the differences between the versions
              Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
         The default action is to keep your current version.
  *** weewx.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?</pre>
        <p>Choosing <span class='code'>I</span> (install the new version) will
            place the previous configuration in
            <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf.dpkg-old</span> where it can
            be compared with the new version
            <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span>
        </p>

        <p>Choosing <span class='code'>O</span> (keep the current version) will
            place the new configuration in
            <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf.dpkg-new</span> where it
            can be compared with the old version
            <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span>
        </p>


        <h1><a name="Upgrading_using_RPM_package">Upgrading using RPM package</a></h1>

        <p>Upgrade to X.Y.Z like this:</p>

        <pre class='tty cmd'>sudo rpm -U weewx-X.Y.Z-R.rpm</pre>

        <p>The upgrade process will not modify the weeWX
            databases.</p>

        <p>Unmodified files will be upgraded. If modifications have been made to
            the configuration, <span class='code'>rpm</span> will display a message
            about any differences between the changes and the new configuration.
            Any new changes from the upgrade will be noted as files with a
            <span class='code'>.rpmnew</span> extension and the modified files will
            be left untouched.</p>

        <p>For example, if <span class='code'>/etc/weewx/weewx.conf</span> was
            modified, <span class='code'>rpm</span> will present a message
            something like this:</p>

        <h2>From V3.6 or earlier</h2>


        <h3 id="change_to_daily_summaries">Changes to daily summaries</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant change in V3.7 is a fix for how daily summary values are calculated
            and stored.</p>
        
        <p>Daily summaries were introduced in V3.0 (December, 2014), to speed up 
            certain kinds of aggregation calculations. They were designed to "weight" values
            depending on the time length of the archive record that contributed them. For example,
            shorter intervals contributed less than longer intervals. This was intended to enable
            changes to the length of the archive interval.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, a bug caused the weightings to all be one (1), regardless of what the actual
            archive interval length
            might be. This means all archive records, long and short, contribute the same amount,
            instead of being weighted by their length. So, if the archive interval were to change,
            averages would be calculated incorrectly.</p>
        
        <p>
            This bug will only affect you if you have changed the length of
            your archive interval, or if you plan to.  If you have not changed
            your archive interval length, and have no plans to do so, then 
            there is nothing you need to do.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            Your archive may have interval values of different sizes if...<br/>
            <br/>
            ... you have imported data using <span class="code">wee_import</span>.<br/>
            <br/>
            ... your hardware has a data logger, your configuration uses
            <span class="code">record_generation=software</span>,
            and the <span class="code">archive_interval</span> is
            different from that in the hardware.<br/>
            <br/>
            ... your archive contains data from more than one type of
            hardware.
        </p>

        <p>The <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><span class="code">wee_database</span></a> utility, with
            option <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility_update"><span class="code">--update</span></a>, can
            fix this problem by recalculating the weights in the daily summary, on the basis
            of the actual archive interval lengths. On a Raspberry Pi 1, model B, it takes about 10
            minutes to fix a database with 10 years of data. On faster machines, it takes much less time.
        </p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">wee_database /etc/weewx/weewx.conf --update</pre>

        <p>
            If you have multiple databases, consider recalculating the weights
            in each database. Interval weighting will only need to be applied
            to databases that have daily summaries, i.e., the binding uses
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">manager = weewx.wxmanager.WXDaySummaryManager</pre>
        <p>
            To apply interval weighting to a database other than the default
            <span class="code">wx_binding</span>, use the
            <span class="code">--binding=BINDING_NAME</span> option in
            conjunction with the <span class="code">--update</span> action.
        </p>
        <pre class="tty cmd">wee_database /etc/weewx/weewx.conf --update --binding=cmon_binding</pre>
        
        <h3 id="recalculation_of_windspeed">Recalculation of <span class="code">windSpeed</span> maximum values</h3>

        <p>Version 3.7 changes how maximum <span class="code">windSpeed</span> is calculated for aggregations
            of a day or more. Previously, if option <span class="code">use_hilo</span> was set
            to <span class="code">True</span> (the usual case), maximum <span class="code">windSpeed</span>
            for a day was set to the maximum value seen in the LOOP packets for
            the day. In practice this is the same value as <span class="code">windGust</span>. That is, these
            two tags would supply the same value:</p>
        
        <pre class="tty">$day.windSpeed.max
$day.windGust.max</pre>
        
        <p>In Version 3.7, this has been changed so the maximum <span class="code">windSpeed</span> is now
            set to the maximum <em>archive</em> value seen during
            the day &mdash; usually a slightly smaller number. However, older daily max values will still
            contain the max LOOP packet values. If you wish to update your older values and have them use the max
            archive record value, use the utility
            <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><span class="code">wee_database</span></a>, with
            option <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility_update"><span class="code">--update</span></a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to <span class="code">wee_database</span></h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="code">wee_database</span> utility has been revised. Whilst
            the v3.6 functionality has been retained, a number of
            the <span class="code">wee_database</span> actions have been renamed and
            new options have been added to support the weighting of daily summaries
            and the recalculation of portions of the windSpeed daily summary table.
            The rebuilding of the daily summaries (formerly backfilling the daily
            summaries) now supports selective rebuilding. Full details on the
            revised <span class="code">wee_database</span> utility can be found in
            the <a href="utilities.htm#wee_database_utility"><i><span class="code">wee_database</span></i></a>
            section in the <i>Utilities Guide</i>.
        </p>


        <h3>Change in the name and locations of examples</h3>
        <p>
            In earlier versions, examples were located with the weeWX code base, and packaged as a Python
            module. This is categorically and semantically incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The examples now live in their own directory, <a href="usersguide.htm#Where_to_find_things">whose location
            is dependent on the installation method</a>. If you use
            an example, you should copy it to the <span class="code">user</span> subdirectory, modify it if necessary,
            then use it there. Your copy will be retained across version upgrades.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td style='width:50%'>3.6</td>

                <td style='width:50%'>3.6</td>

                    <pre class='tty'><span class="changed">xsearch.py</span></pre>

                <td>
                    <pre class='tty'><span class="changed">stats.py</span></pre>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>


        <h3>Changes to sensor mapping</h3>
        <p>
            The mapping of sensors to database fields was formalized in Version
            3.7, resulting in changes to the configuration for some of the
            drivers, including
            <span class="code">cc3000</span>,
            <span class="code">te923</span>,
            <span class="code">wmr100</span>,
            <span class="code">wmr200</span>,
            <span class="code">wmr300</span>, and
            <span class="code">wmr9x8</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the <span class="code">wmr200</span> driver, until Version 3.6,
            the fields extraTemp1 and extraHumid1 were not usable.
            Version 3.6.1 shifted the extraTemp and extraHumid mappings down
            one channel, so that extraTemp1 corresponded to channel 2,
            extraTemp2 corresponded to channel 3, and so on.  The mappings can
            now be modified by a change to the configuration file, and the
            default mappings are as follows:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td style='width:50%'>3.6</td>
                <td>3.7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                <pre class='tty'>** hard-coded in the driver **

outTemp = temperature_1
# extraTemp1 is not usable
extraTemp2 = temperature_2

        <h2>From V2.7 or earlier</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>While a lot has changed with Version 3, the upgrade process should
            take care of most changes for most users. However, if you have
            installed an extension or, especially, if you have written a custom
            service, search list extension, or uploader, you will have to make
            some changes.</p>

        <h3>Database contents</h3>

        <p>
            With Version 3, there is no longer a separate "stats" database.
            Instead, "daily summaries" have been included in the same database as
            the archive data &mdash; everything is under one name. For example,
            if you are using sqlite, both the archive data and the daily summaries
            will be inside file <span class="code">weewx.sdb</span>. With MySQL,
            everything is inside the database weeWX. This
            makes it easier to keep all data together when working with multiple
            databases.
        </p>

        <p>This change in database structure should be transparent to you. On
            startup, weewx will automatically backfill the new internal daily
            summaries from the archive data. Your old "stats" database will no
            longer be used and may safely set aside or even deleted.
        </p>

        <h3>Pressure calibration</h3>

        <p>
            Since the new <span class="code">StdWXCalculate</span> service is
            applied after the <span class="code">StdCalibrate</span> services, the
            <span class='code'>pressure_offset</span> parameter is no longer
            necessary; pressure calibration can be applied just like any other
            calibration. If your pressure was calibrated using the
            <span class='code'>pressure_offset</span>
            parameter, move the calibration to the
            <span class="code">[StdCalibrate]</span>
            section. This applies only to CC3000, FineOffsetUSB, Ultimeter, WS1,
            WS23xx, and WS28xx hardware.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="code">weewx.conf</span></h3>

        <p>
            A version 2.X <span class="code">weewx.conf</span> file is not
            compatible with Version 3.X. However, the upgrade process should
            automatically update the file. Nevertheless, the changes are
            documented below:

        <h3>Extensions</h3>

        <p>
            Many skins will work in v3 with no modification required. However,
            every search list extension will have to be upgraded, every restful
            extension must be upgraded, and some other services must be upgraded.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no automated upgrade system for extensions; if an extension
            must be upgraded, you must do it manually. If the extension has any
            python code, this will mean replacing any v2-compatible code with
            v3-compatible code. In some cases parts of the configuration file
            <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span> must be modified.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, to update the <span class='code'>pmon</span> extension,
            replace <span class='code'>bin/user/pmon.py</span> with the
            v3-compatible <span class='code'>pmon.py</span> and modify
            <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span> as shown in this table:

        <h3>Search list extensions</h3>

        <p>
            The introduction of <em>data bindings</em> has meant a change in the
            calling signature of <em>search list extensions.</em> By way of
            example, here's the example from the section
            <a href="customizing.htm#extending_the_list"><i>Extending the list</i></a>
            in the <i>Customizing Guide</i>, with the
            differences highlighted.

        <p>A few things to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the extension function has changed from
                <span class="code">get_extension</span> to <span class="code">get_extension_list</span>.
            </li>
            <li>The calling signature has changed. Instead of an archive database
                and a stats database being passed in, a single <em>database lookup
                    function</em> is passed in.
            </li>
            <li>The name of the top-level class in the tag chain has changed from
                <span class="code">TimeSpanStats</span> to <span class="code">TimespanBinder</span>.
                See the <i>Customizing Guide</i> for details.
            </li>
            <li>Instead of returning a single search list extension, the function
                should now return a Python <span class="code">list</span> of
                extensions. The list will be searched in order.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Derived quantities</h3>

        <p>Some calculations that were done in drivers or in hardware are now
            done consistently by the new StdWXCalculate service. Drivers should no
            longer calculate derived quantities such as windchill, heatindex,
            dewpoint, or rain rate.</p>

        <h3>Driver APIs</h3>

        <p>The base class for drivers has been renamed, and new, optional,
            methods have been defined to provide hooks for configuring hardware
            and producing default and upgraded configuration stanzas.</p>

        <p>These changes affect only those who have written custom drivers.</p>
        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">

        <h3>Service APIs</h3>

        <p>The base class for services has moved.</p>

        <p>This affects only those who have written custom services.</p>
        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td style='width:50%'>2.7</td>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>RESTful APIs</h3>

        <p>Some of the methods internal to RESTful services have changed,
            specifically those that relate to getting configuration options
            from <span class='code'>weewx.conf</span> and configuring databases.
        </p>

        <p>This affects only those who have written custom RESTful services.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of obtaining the database dictionary for use in
            the RESTful service thread.</p>
        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td style='width:50%'>2.7</td>

db_name = config_dict['StdArchive']['archive_database']
db_dict = config_dict['Databases'][db_name]
site_dict.setdefault('database_dict', db_dict)</pre>
                </td>
                <td><pre class="tty">site_dict = config_dict['StdRESTful']['Uploader']

    config_dict, 'wx_binding')</pre>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Database APIs</h3>

        <p>The methods for obtaining, opening, and querying databases have
            changed. This affects only those who have written code that accesses
            databases.</p>

        <p>
            The class <span class="code">Manager</span> and its subclasses have
            replaced the old <span class="code">Archive</span> class. The table
            name is no longer hard-coded, so developers should use the table name
            from the database binding. There is no longer a separate
            <span class="code">StatsDb</span>
            class, its functions having been subsumed into the
            <span class="code">Manager</span>
            class and its subclasses.
        </p>

        <p>
            A new class <span class="code">DBBinder</span> is the preferred way of
            getting a <span class="code">Manager</span> class, as it will
            automatically take care of instantiating the right class, as well as
            caching instances of <span class="code">Manager</span>. An instance of
            <span class="code">DBBinder</span> is held by the engine as attribute
            <span class="code">db_binder</span>. Here's an example of making a
            simple query.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td style='width:50%'>2.7</td>

                     mgr.table_name, (start_ts, end_ts))</pre>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Generator APIs</h3>

        <p>
            The base class for report generators has changed. The old class
            <span class="code">CachedReportGenerator</span> no longer exists; its
            functionality has been replaced by an instance of
            <span class="code">DBBinder</span>,
            held by the generator superclass. This affects only those who have
            written customer generators.
        </p>

        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <table>
            <tr class="first_row">
                <td style='width: 50%'>2.7</td>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Extension installer</h3>

        <p>The <span class='code'>setup.py</span> utility is now included in the
            installation; it is no longer necessary to keep a copy of the
            weeWX source tree just for the

        <p>For .deb and .rpm installations, the command

        <h2>From V2.6 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 2.7 is backwards compatible with earlier versions with
            one minor exception.</p>

        <p>
            It now includes the ability to localize the weewx and server
            uptimes. Previously, the labels <span class="code">days</span>,
            <span class="code">hours</span>, and <span class="code">minutes</span>
            were hardcoded in a Python utility. There was no way of changing
            them. Now, like any other labels, they are taken from the skin
            configuration file, <span class="code">skin.conf</span>, section
            <span class="code">[[Labels]]</span>. Older configuration files had a
            definition for <span class="code">hour</span>, but none for
            <span class="code">day</span>, and <span class="code">minute</span>.
            Also, the old definition for <span class="code">hour</span> used an
            abbreviation <span class="code">hrs</span> instead of
            <span class="code">hours</span>.
        </p>

        <p>If you do nothing, your weewx and station uptimes will look
            like:</p>
        <pre class="tty">Weewx uptime:  1 day, 1 hrs, 41 minutes
Server uptime: 2 days, 10 hrs, 22 minutes</pre>
        <p>
            Note how the label for hours is abbreviated and always uses the
            plural. If you want the previous behavior, or if you want to
            localize the labels, you should update your skin configuration file.
            Remove the old entries for <span class="code">hour</span> and
            <span class="code">second</span> and replace them with:
        </p>
        <pre class="tty">day               = " day",    " days"
hour              = " hour",   " hours"
minute            = " minute", " minutes"
second            = " second", " seconds"</pre>

        <p>The first item is the singular spelling, the second the plural. This
            will result in the desired</p>
        <pre class="tty">Weewx uptime:  1 day, 1 hour, 41 minutes
Server uptime: 2 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes</pre>

        <h2>From V2.5 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 2.6 is backwards compatible with earlier versions, with a couple
            of small exceptions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have written a custom weeWX
                service, the install routine will try to insert its name into
                an appropriate place in one of the five new lists of services
                to be run. You should check
                section <span class="code">[Engines][[WxEngine]]</span> to
                make sure it made a reasonable guess.
            </li>
            <li>If you have written a custom RESTful service, the
                architecture for these services has completely changed. They
                are now first class services, and are treated like any other
                weeWX service. There are some guides
                to writing RESTful services using the new architecture at the
                top of the file <span class='code'>bin/weewx/restx.py</span>.
                I can also help you with the transition.
            </li>
            <li>Option <span class='code'>interval</span> in the CWOP
                configuration section has become option
                <span class='code'>post_interval</span>. This change
                should be done automatically by the install routine.
            </li>
            <li>The mechanism for specifying RESTful services has changed.
                To activate a RESTful service, put the driver in the
                <span class="code">restful_services</span> list in
                <span class="code">[Engines][[WxEngine]]</span>. The
                <span class="code">driver</span> parameter is no longer
                necessary in the RESTful service's configuration stanza.
                These changes should be done automatically by the
                install routine.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>From V2.3 or earlier</h2>

        <p>The option <span class="code">time_length</span> will now be the exact
            length of the resultant plot. Before, a plot with
            <span class="code">time_length</span> equal to 24 hours would result
            in a plot of 27 hours, now it's 24 hours. If you want the old behavior,
            set it equal to 27 hours. To do this, change your section
            in <span class="code">skin.conf</span> from</p>

        <pre class="tty">[[day_images]]
    x_label_format = %H:%M
    bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M
    time_length = 86400 # == 24 hours</pre>

        <p>to</p>

        <pre class="tty">[[day_images]]
    x_label_format = %H:%M
    bottom_label_format = %m/%d/%y %H:%M
    <span class="highlight">time_length = 97200 # == 27 hours</span></pre>

        <p>The service <span class="code">StdTimeSync</span> now synchronizes the
            console's onboard clock on startup. This is nice because if the clock
            failed, perhaps because the battery was taken out, the time is
            corrected first <em>before</em> data is downloaded from the logger's
            memory. To take advantage of this, you can move service
            <span class="code">StdTimeSync</span> to the front of the list of
            services to be run. For example:</p>

        <pre class="tty">[[WxEngine]]
    # The list of services the main weewx engine should run:
    service_list = <span class="highlight">weewx.wxengine.StdTimeSynch</span>, weewx.wxengine.StdConvert,
    weewx.wxengine.StdCalibrate, weewx.wxengine.StdQC, weewx.wxengine.StdArchive, weewx.wxengine.StdPrint,
    weewx.wxengine.StdRESTful, weewx.wxengine.StdReport</pre>

        <h2>From V2.2 or earlier</h2>

        <p>The signature of the function "<span class="code">loader</span>", used
            to return an instance of the station device driver, has changed
            slightly. It has changed from</p>

        <pre class="tty">loader(config_dict)</pre>

        <p>to</p>

        <pre class="tty">loader(config_dict, engine)</pre>

        <p>That is, a second parameter, <span class="code">engine</span>, has been
            added. This is a reference to the
            weeWX engine.</p>

        <p>This change will affect only those who have written their own device
            driver. </p>

        <h2>From V2.1 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 2.2 introduces a schema, found in <span class="code">
        bin/user/schemas.py</span>, for the stats database. This schema is used
            only when initially creating the database. If you have a specialized
            stats database, that is, one that saves types other than the default
            that comes with weeWX, you should edit this
            file to reflect your changes before attempting to rebuild the database.
        </p>

        <h2>From V1.14 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 2.0 introduces many new features, including a revamped internal
            engine. There are two changes that are not backwards compatible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The configuration file, <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. When
                upgrading from V1.X, the setup utility will
                install a new, fresh copy of <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>,
                which you will then have to edit by hand. Thereafter, V2.X upgrades
                should be automatic.
            </li>
            <li>Custom services. If you have written a custom service, it will have
                to be updated to use the new engine. The overall architecture is
                very similar, except that functions must be <em>bound</em> to
                events, rather than get called implicitly. See the sections
                <a href="customizing.htm#Customizing_a_service">Customizing a Service</a> and <a
                        href="customizing.htm#Adding_a_service">Adding a Service</a>
                in the <a href="customizing.htm">Customizing Guide</a> for details
                on how to do this.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All skins should be completely backwards compatible, so you should not
            have to change your templates or skin configuration file,
            <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. </p>

        <p>If you have written a custom report generator it should also be
            backwards compatible.</p>

        <h2>From V1.13 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 1.14 introduces some new webpages that have been expressly
            formatted for the smartphone by using
            <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>

        <p>The skins shipped with the distribution take advantage of these
            features. If you do nothing, your old skins will continue to work, but
            you will not be taking advantage of these new webpages.</p>

        <p>If you want them, then you have two choices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rename your old skin directory (call it &quot;<span class="code">skins.old</span>&quot;)
                then do the install. This will install the new skin distribution. You can
                then modify it to reflect any changes you have made, referring to <span class="code">
            skins.old</span> for guidance. If you have not changed many things, this
                approach will be the easiest.
            </li>
            <li>Alternatively, change the contents of your existing skin directory to
                include the new webpages. If you take this approach, you will need to copy
                over the contents of the subdirectory <span class="code">
            skins/Standard/smartphone</span> from the distribution into your <span class="code">skins/Standard</span>
                directory. You will then need to modify your <span class="code">skin.conf</span>.
                <p>After the section that looks like</p>

                <pre class='tty'>[[[Mobile]]]
    template = mobile.html.tmpl</pre>

                <p>add the following directives:</p>

                <pre class='tty'>[[[MobileSmartphone]]]
    template = smartphone/index.html.tmpl
[[[MobileTempOutside]]]
    template = smartphone/temp_outside.html.tmpl
[[[MobileRain]]]
    template = smartphone/rain.html.tmpl
[[[MobileBarometer]]]
    template = smartphone/barometer.html.tmpl
[[[MobileWind]]]
    template = smartphone/wind.html.tmpl
[[[MobileRadar]]]
    template = smartphone/radar.html.tmpl</pre>

                <p>Then modify section <span class="code">[CopyGenerator]</span>
                    to add the <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> files:</p>

                <pre class='tty'>[CopyGenerator]
    #
    # This section is used by the generator CopyGenerator
    #
    
    # List of files that are to be copied at the first invocation of the generator only
    copy_once = backgrounds/*, weewx.css, mobile.css, favicon.ico, <span class="highlight">smartphone/icons/*, smartphone/custom.js</span></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whichever approach you chose, the generated files will appear in
            <span class="code">public_html/smartphone</span>. The start of the document root
            will be at <span class="code">public_html/smartphone/index.html</span>. You may want
            to add a link to this in the template for your main index page
            <span class="code">skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl</span>.</p>

        <h2>From V1.12 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 1.13 changed the way binding happens to the databases used in reports
            so that it happens much later. The upshot is that the signature of a few
            functions changed. Most you are unlikely to encounter. The exception is if you
            have written custom template <em>search lists</em>, as described in the
            <a href="customizing.htm">Customizing weewx guide</a>. This section has been
            updated to reflect the new function signatures. As a side effect, the
            illustrated example actually has become much simpler!</p>

        <p>No changes to skins.</p>

        <h2>From V1.9 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Version 1.10 introduced several new features. </p>

        <h3>New almanac features, icon, and mobile template</h3>

        <p>Version 1.10 introduces some extra almanac features, such as the azimuth and
            elevation of the sun and moon, or when the next solstice will be. It also
            includes a template formatted for smartphones, as well as an icon (&quot;<span
                    class="code">favicon.ico</span>&quot;)
            that displays in your browser toolbar. The skins shipped with the distribution
            take advantage of these features. If you do nothing, your old skins will
            continue to work, but you will not take advantage of these new features. </p>

        <p>If you want these new features then you have two choices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rename your old skin directory (call it &quot;<span class="code">skin.old</span>&quot;)
                then do the install. This will install the new skin distribution. You can
                modify it to reflect any changes you have made, referring to <span class="code">
            skin.old</span> for guidance.
            </li>
            <li>Alternatively, change the contents of your existing skin directory to take
                advantage of the new features. If you take this approach, you will need to
                copy over files <span class="code">favicon.ico, mobile.css</span>, and
                <span class="code">mobile.html.tmpl</span> from the distribution into your <span
                        class="code">skin/Standard</span>
                directory. Modify <span class="code">skins/Standard/index.html.tmpl</span>
                to take advantage of the new almanac features, using the version shipped
                with the distribution for guidance. You will then need to modify your <span
                        class="code">skin.conf</span>.
                <p>Add a new <span class="code">[[[Mobile]]]</span> section:</p>

                <pre class="tty">[FileGenerator]
    ...
    [[ToDate]]
        ...
    [[[Mobile]]]
        template = mobile.html.tmpl</pre>

                <p>Then add <span class="code">mobile.css</span> and <span class="code">
                favicon.ico</span> to the list of files to be copied on report generation:</p>

                <pre class="tty">[CopyGenerator]
    copy_once = backgrounds/*, weewx.css, mobile.css, favicon.ico</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Which approach you should take will depend on how extensively you have
            modified the stock skin distribution. If the modifications are slight,
            approach #1 will be easier, otherwise use approach #2.</p>

        <h3>Backwards compatibility</h3>

        <p>With the introduction of explicit control of output units in the
            templates such as</p>

        <pre class="tty">$day.outTemp.max.degree_C</pre>

        <p>the calling signature of the following two Python classes was changed</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">weewx.stats.TaggedStats</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">weewx.stats.TimeSpanStats</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The example of writing a custom generator <span class="code">MyFileGenerator</span>
            (which produced &quot;all time&quot; statistics) has been changed to reflect the new
            signatures.</p>

        <p>This will only affect you if you have written a custom generator.</p>

        <h2>From V1.7.0 or earlier</h2>

        <p>With the introduction of a standard archiving service, <span class="code">
        StdArchive</span>, the names of some events have changed. This will not affect
            you unless you have written a custom service.</p>

        <h2>From V.1.5.0 or earlier</h2>

        <p>V1.7 introduces <em>skins</em>. The skins live in subdirectory
            <span class="code">skins</span>. They are <em>not</em> compatible with the old
            <span class="code">template</span> subdirectory --- you can&#39;t simply rename
            <span class="code">templates</span> to <span class="code">skins</span>. </p>

        <p>The part of the configuration file dealing with the presentation layer has
            been split off into a separate file <span class="code">skin.conf</span>. Hence,
            once again, the installation script
            <span class="code">setup.py</span> will NOT merge your old <span class="code">
            weewx.conf</span> configuration file
            into the new one. You will have to re-edit <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            to put in your customizations. You may also have to edit <span class="code">
            skin.conf</span> for whatever skin you choose (right now, only one skin, <em>Standard</em>,
            comes with the distribution).</p>

        <p>However, a reinstall of V1.7 <em>will</em> merge your changes for
            <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>. It will also merge any changes you have made to <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
            as well.</p>

        <p>Please check the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Option &quot;<span class="code">altitude</span>&quot; in section
                <span class="code">[Station]</span> now takes a unit. Hence, it
                should look something like:
                <pre class='tty'>altitude = 120, meter</pre>

            </li>
            <li>In a similar manner, options <span class="code">heating_base</span>
                and <span class="code">cooling_base</span> in
                <span class="code">skin.conf</span>
                also take units:
                <pre class='tty'>heating_base = 65, degree_F
cooling_base = 65, degree_F</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The directory &#39;<span class="code">templates</span>&#39; is no
            longer used; it has been replaced with directory
            &#39;<span class="code">skins</span>&#39;. You
            may delete it if you wish:</p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">rm -r templates</pre>

        <h2>From V1.4.0 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Because the configuration file <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            changed significantly going from V1.4 to V1.5, the installation script
            <span class="code">setup.py</span> will NOT merge your old
            configuration file into the new one. You will have to re-edit
            <span class="code">weewx.conf</span>
            to put in your customizations.</p>

        <h2>From V1.2.0 or earlier</h2>

        <p>Option <span class="code">clock_check</span>, previously found in the
            <span class="code">[VantagePro]</span>
            section, is now found in the
            <span class="code">[Station]</span> section. The install program will
            put a default value in the new place, but it will not delete nor move
            your old value over. If you have changed this value or if you
            cannot stand the thought of
            <span class="code">clock_check</span> appearing in two different
            places, you should delete the old one found under
            <span class="code">[VantagePro]</span> and
            make sure the new value, found under
            <span class="code">[Station]</span> is
            correct.</p>

        <p>Two Python files are no longer used, so they may be deleted from your
            installation if you wish:</p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">rm bin/weewx/processdata.py
rm bin/weewx/mainloop.py</pre>

        <p>In addition, file <span class="code">readme.htm</span> has been moved to
            subdirectory <span class='code'>docs</span>, so the old one
            can be deleted:</p>

        <pre class="tty cmd">rm readme.htm</pre>
