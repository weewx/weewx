                    Possible NEW FEATURES

Eliminate the need for Ftp/skin.conf and Rsync/skin.conf.  More generally,
do not require a skin.conf file for each report.  In the case of Ftp and Rsync
one can simply put the generator_list in weewx.conf as part of the report
definition.  A report with no skin.conf should run with sane defaults.
Templates should also be "drop in." If they appear in the directory, they
get used.

Minor cleanup to the Standard skin:
 - improve layout, possibly like http://www.kanonbra.com/veret/
 - punt the buttons for week/month/year, use regular html links instead
 - include a table instead of duplicating html code for stats
 - make the info section easier to grok with a structured layout, perhaps
    similar to weather display or cumulus default templates

Offer tags to support JSON. In particular, vectors. A tag like
$day.outTemp.vector would offer a vector of temperatures for the day.
Aggregation would be nice.

A QC "Spike" detector.

Harden up the MySQL database connection.

Offer "cumulative" as an aggregation type.

Allow rain-to-date to be added to a partial rainyear.

Fix scaling for aggregate interval of a week, so it starts on a Sunday.

More dynamic access to the database. Check out
Werkzeug. http://werkzeug.pocoo.org [1/27/2017. This is essentially weeRT]

Dynamic web updates, using AJAX, or Meteor.

Port to Windows.

Allow variable y-axis labelling. Right now it's hardwired to every other major
tick mark.

Add log_success/log_failure parameters for subsystems other than just restx.
