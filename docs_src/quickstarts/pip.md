# Installation using pip

This is a guide to installing WeeWX using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io), the
*Preferred Installer Program* for Python. It can be used on almost any
operating system that offers Python v3.6 or greater. Python 2, or earlier
versions of Python 3, will not work.

Although you do not need root privileges to install and configure WeeWX using
`pip`, you will need them to set up a daemon, and you may need them to change
device permissions.

## Install `pip` and `venv`

While there are many ways to install WeeWX using `pip` (see the wiki document
[_`pip` install strategies_](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/pip-install-strategies)
for a partial list), we recommend creating a _Python virtual environment_,
because it is the least likely to disturb the rest of your system. It is
worth reading about [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
the module used to create a virtual environment, in the Python3 documentation.

To ensure that your Python has both `pip` and `venv`, follow the instructions
below for your system. For details, see the document [Installing `pip` with
Linux Package Managers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/).


=== "Debian"
    
    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip -y
    sudo apt install python3-venv -y
    ```
    _Tested with Debian 10, 12, RPi OS 32-bit, Ubuntu 20.04, and 22.04._

=== "Redhat 8"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install python3-importlib-resources
    sudo yum install python3-pip -y
    sudo yum install python3-venv -y
    ```
    _Tested with Rocky 8.7._

=== "Redhat 9"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install python3-pip -y
    ```
    _Tested with Rocky 9.1 and 9.2._

=== "openSUSE"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo zypper refresh
    sudo zypper install python3-importlib_resources
    sudo zypper install python3-pip -y
    sudo zypper install python3-venv -y
    ```
    _Tested with openSUSE Leap 15.5._

=== "FreeBSD"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo pkg install py39-pip
    sudo pkg install py39-sqlite3
    sudo pkg install py39-Pillow
    ```
    _Tested with FreeBSD 13.2 and 14.0_

    _On BSD systems, it is easier to use the packaged py39-Pillow than it is
    to do a pip install of Pillow into a virtual environment, since the latter
    requires many other development packages_

=== "macOS"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # There is no step 1!
    # The python3 included with macOS already has pip and venv installed
    ```
    _Tested on macOS 13.4 (Ventura)_    


## Install in a virtual environment

To install WeeWX in a virtual environment, follow the directions below.

```{ .shell .copy }
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/weewx-venv
# Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
# Install WeeWX into the virtual environment
python3 -m pip install weewx
```

When you are finished, the WeeWX executables and dependencies will have been
installed inside the virtual environment.

If you have any problems, see the wiki article
[_Troubleshooting pip installs_](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/pip-troubleshooting)
for help.

## Provision a new station

While the instructions above install WeeWX, they do not set up the
configuration specific to your station, nor do they set up the reporting
skins. That is the job of the tool `weectl`.

```{ .shell .copy }
# Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
# Create the station data
weectl station create
```

The tool `weectl` will ask you a series of questions, then create a directory
`weewx-data` in your home directory with a new configuration file, skins,
utility files, and examples. The database and reports will also go into that
directory, but only after you run `weewxd`, as shown in the following step.


## Run `weewxd`

The program `weewxd` does the data collection, archiving, uploading, and
report generation.  You can run it directly, or as a daemon.


### Run directly

When you run WeeWX directly, it will print data to the screen. WeeWX will
stop when you log out, or when you terminate it with `control-c`.

```{ .shell .copy }
# Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
# Run weewxd
weewxd
```

### Run as a daemon

To make WeeWX start when the system is booted, you will want to run `weewxd`
as a daemon. Run the daemon setup script to configure your system. This script
installs the startup/shutdown configuration appropriate to your operating
system. You will need root privileges to do this.

```{ .shell .copy }
sudo sh ~/weewx-data/scripts/setup-daemon.sh
```

Then follow the directions below to start `weewxd` as a daemon.

=== "systemd"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # For Linux systems that use systemd, e.g., Debian, Redhat, and SUSE.
    sudo systemctl start weewx
    ```
    
=== "SysV"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # For Linux systems that use SysV init, e.g., Slackware, Devuan, and Puppy.
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start
    ```

=== "BSD"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # For BSD systems, e.g., FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
    sudo service weewx start
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # For macOS systems.
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.weewx.weewxd.plist
    ```


## Verify

After about 5 minutes (the exact length of time depends on your archive
interval), copy the following and paste into a web browser. You should
see your station information and data.

    ~/weewx-data/public_html/index.html

!!! Note
    Not all browsers understand the tilde ("`~`") mark. You may
    have to substitute an explicit path to your home directory,
    for example, `file:///home/jackhandy` instead of `~`.

If you have problems, check the
[system log](../usersguide/monitoring.md#log-messages).
See the [*Troubleshooting*](../usersguide/troubleshooting/what-to-do.md)
section of the [*User's guide*](../usersguide/introduction.md) for more help.


## Configure

If you chose the simulator as your station type, then at some point you will
probably want to switch to using real hardware. This is how to reconfigure.

=== "systemd"
 
    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # Stop the weewx daemon:
    sudo systemctl stop weewx
    # Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
    source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
    # Reconfigure to use your hardware
    weectl station reconfigure
    # Remove the old database
    rm ~/weewx-data/archive/weewx.sdb
    # Start the weewx daemon
    sudo systemctl start weewx
    ```

=== "SysV"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # Stop the weewx daemon:
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
    # Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
    source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
    # Reconfigure to use your hardware
    weectl station reconfigure
    # Remove the old database
    rm ~/weewx-data/archive/weewx.sdb
    # Start the weewx daemon
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start
    ```

=== "BSD"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # Stop the weewx daemon:
    sudo service weewx stop
    # Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
    source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
    # Reconfigure to use your hardware
    weectl station reconfigure
    # Remove the old database
    rm ~/weewx-data/archive/weewx.sdb
    # Start the weewx daemon
    sudo service weewx start
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    # Stop the weewx daemon:
    sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.weewx.weewxd.plist
    # Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
    source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
    # Reconfigure to use your hardware
    weectl station reconfigure
    # Remove the old database
    rm ~/weewx-data/archive/weewx.sdb
    # Start the weewx daemon
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.weewx.weewxd.plist
    ```


## Customize

To enable uploads, or to enable other reports, modify the configuration file
`~/weewx-data/weewx.conf` using any text editor such as `nano`:

```{.shell .copy}
nano ~/weewx-data/weewx.conf
```

The reference
[*Application options*](../reference/weewx-options/introduction.md)
contains an extensive list of the configuration options, with explanations for
what they do. For more advanced customization, see the [*Customization
Guide*](../custom/introduction.md), as well as the reference [*Skin
options*](../reference/skin-options/introduction.md).
 
To install new skins, drivers, or other extensions, use the [extension
utility](../utilities/weectl-extension.md).

WeeWX must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

=== "systemd"
 
    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo systemctl restart weewx
    ```

=== "SysV"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start
    ```

=== "BSD"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo service weewx stop
    sudo service weewx start
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.weewx.weewxd.plist
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.weewx.weewxd.plist
    ```


## Upgrade

Get the latest release using `pip`:

```{ .shell .copy }
# Activate the WeeWX virtual environment
source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
# Upgrade the WeeWX code
python3 -m pip install weewx --upgrade
```

Optional: You may want to upgrade examples and utility files:
```
weectl station upgrade --what examples util
```

Optional: You may want to upgrade your skins, although this may break or
remove modifications you have made to them. Your old skins will be saved
in a timestamped directory.
```
weectl station upgrade --what skins
```

Optional: You may want to upgrade your configuration file.  This is only
necessary in the rare case that a new WeeWX release is not backward
compatible with older configuration files.
```
weectl station upgrade --what config
```


## Uninstall

Before you uninstall, be sure that `weewxd` is not running.

=== "systemd"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo systemctl stop weewx
    ```

=== "SysV"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
    ```

=== "BSD"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo service weewx stop
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```{ .shell .copy }
    sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.weewx.weewxd.plist
    ```

If you installed a daemon configuration, remove it:

```{ .shell .copy }
sudo sh ~/weewx-data/scripts/setup-daemon.sh uninstall
```

To delete the applications and code, remove the WeeWX virtual environment:

```{ .shell .copy }
rm -r ~/weewx-venv
```

Finally, if desired, to delete the database, skins, and other utilities,
remove the data directory:

```{ .shell .copy }
rm -r ~/weewx-data
```
