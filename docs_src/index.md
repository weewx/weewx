# Introduction to WeeWX

The WeeWX weather system is written in Python and runs on Linux, MacOSX,
Solaris, and *BSD. It collects data from many types of weather stations and
sensors, then generates plots, HTML pages, and monthly and yearly summary
reports. It can push plots, pages, and reports to a web server, and data to
many online weather services.

Initial development began in the winter of 2008-2009, with the first release in
2009. WeeWX is about 25,000 lines of code, plus another 15,000 for the hardware
drivers.

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/weewx/weewx).
Installation instructions and releases are available at
[weewx.com/downloads](http://weewx.com/downloads).

See the [hardware list](https://weewx.com/hardware.html) for a complete list
of supported stations, and for pictures to help identify your hardware!  The
[hardware comparison](https://weewx.com/hwcmp.html) shows specifications for
many types of hardware, including some not yet supported by WeeWX.

The WeeWX distribution includes drivers for many types of hardware. These
are listed in the driver list in the [Hardware Guide](hardware/drivers.md).
See the [WeeWX Wiki](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki) for additional
drivers and other extensions.
